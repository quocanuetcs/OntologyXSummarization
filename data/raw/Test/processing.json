                "article": "As with many disorders of the spinal cord, no effective cure currently exists for people with transverse myelitis. Treatments are designed to manage and alleviate symptoms and largely depend upon the severity of neurological involvement. Therapy generally begins when the patient first experiences symptoms. Physicians often prescribe corticosteroid therapy during the first few weeks of illness to decrease inflammation. Although no clinical trials have investigated whether corticosteroids alter the course of transverse myelitis, these drugs often are prescribed to reduce immune system activity because of the suspected autoimmune mechanisms involved in the disorder. Corticosteroid medications that might be prescribed may include methylprednisone or dexamethasone.[1] Chronic pain is a common complication of transverse myelitis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn, others) can help reduce inflammation and relieve pain.[6] Bed rest is often recommended during the initial days and weeks after onset of the disorder.[1] Based on patient response and test results, additional therapeutic options may be added. Plasma exchange therapy is often used for those with moderate to severe transverse myelitis who dont show much improvement after being treated with intravenous steroids.[4][5] This therapy involves removing the straw-colored fluid in which blood cells are suspended (plasma) and replacing the plasma loss with special fluids. It's not certain how this therapy helps people with transverse myelitis, but it may be that plasma exchange removes antibodies that are involved in inflammation.[5] Some patients respond very well to intravenous cyclophosphamide (a drug often used for lymphomas or leukemia). It is very important that an experienced oncology team be involved in the administration of this drug, and patients should be monitored carefully. Ongoing treatment with chemical agents that modify immune response (such as azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate or oral cyclophosphamide) can be considered for the small subset of patients that experience recurrent transverse myelitis.[4] Individuals with permanent physical disabilities may benefit from physical therapy , occupational therapy and vocational therapy.[1] FDA-Approved Treatments The medication(s) listed below have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as orphan products for treatment of this condition.

                "article": "Transverse myelitis is a neurological disorder caused by inflammation of the spinal cord, which carries nerve signals from the brain to the rest of the body. The segment of the spinal cord that has inflammation or damage determines the symptoms a person has. Generally, inflammation at one segment causes symptoms at that level and below that level. Most commonly, the upper spinal cord is affected, causing impaired leg movement, and problems controlling the bowel and bladder. The onset of symptoms may be acute (sudden, developing over hours or days) or subacute (developing over weeks).[1] The cause of transverse myelitis may be unknown (idiopathic) or it may be associated with a wide variety of underlying health problems, including infections, immune system disorders, and other inflammatory disorders.[1][2] Tests that may be used to diagnose transverse myelitis include MRI to look for compression or inflammation of the spinal cord, and a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to look for evidence of inflammation in the fluid surrounding the spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid). Treatment options may include intravenous steroids, pain medicines, plasmapheresis (also called plasma exchange), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and cyclophosphamide.[1][2] Some people have full or partial recovery from symptoms, while others do not recover any lost function in the affected parts of the body.[3] Most people recover at least partially, although recovery can take up to 2 or 3 years. In general however, if there is no improvement within the first 6 months, a significant recovery is not likely.[1]",

                "article": "Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. While glaucoma can strike anyone, the risk is much greater for people over 60. How Glaucoma Develops There are several different types of glaucoma. Most of these involve the drainage system within the eye. At the front of the eye there is a small space called the anterior chamber. A clear fluid flows through this chamber and bathes and nourishes the nearby tissues. (Watch the video to learn more about glaucoma. To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) In glaucoma, for still unknown reasons, the fluid drains too slowly out of the eye. As the fluid builds up, the pressure inside the eye rises. Unless this pressure is controlled, it may cause damage to the optic nerve and other parts of the eye and result in loss of vision. Open-angle Glaucoma The most common type of glaucoma is called open-angle glaucoma. In the normal eye, the clear fluid leaves the anterior chamber at the open angle where the cornea and iris meet. When fluid reaches the angle, it flows through a spongy meshwork, like a drain, and leaves the eye. Sometimes, when the fluid reaches the angle, it passes too slowly through the meshwork drain, causing the pressure inside the eye to build. If the pressure damages the optic nerve, open-angle glaucoma -- and vision loss -- may result. There is no cure for glaucoma. Vision lost from the disease cannot be restored. However, there are treatments that may save remaining vision. That is why early diagnosis is important. See this graphic for a quick overview of glaucoma, including how many people it affects, whos at risk, what to do if you have it, and how to learn more. See a glossary of glaucoma terms.",

People with dementia have significantly impaired intellectual functioning that interferes with normal activities and relationships. They also lose their ability to solve problems and maintain emotional control, and they may experience personality changes and behavioral problems, such as agitation, delusions, and hallucinations. While memory loss is a common symptom of dementia, memory loss by itself does not mean that a person has dementia. Doctors diagnose dementia only if two or more brain functions - such as memory and language skills -- are significantly impaired without loss of consciousness. Some of the diseases that can cause symptoms of dementia are Alzheimers disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Huntingtons disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Doctors have identified other conditions that can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms including reactions to medications, metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities, nutritional deficiencies, infections, poisoning, brain tumors, anoxia or hypoxia (conditions in which the brains oxygen supply is either reduced or cut off entirely), and heart and lung problems.

These national efforts, in turn, will build greater global preparedness for the next pandemic. Globally, the strategy will focus on research and innovation. This will include improved influenza modelling and forecasting, along with the development of new vaccines, including a possible universal influenza vaccine.This page links all WHO technical and general information on influenza",

                "article": "See FDA-Approved Medication Guide Information for Patients Patients should be made aware that zoledronic acid injection contains the same active ingredient (zoledronic acid) found in Zometa   , and that patients being treated with Zometa should not be treated with zoledronic acid injection. Zoledronic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min [see Contraindications (4)]. Before being given zoledronic acid injection, patients should tell their doctor if they have kidney problems and what medications they are taking. Zoledronic acid injection should not be given if the patient is pregnant or plans to become pregnant, or if she is breast-feeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. There have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin-sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid injection. Before being given zoledronic acid injection, patients should tell their doctor if they are aspirin-sensitive. If the patient had surgery to remove some or all of the parathyroid glands in their neck, or had sections of their intestine removed, or are unable to take calcium supplements they should tell their doctor. Zoledronic acid injection is given as an infusion into a vein by a nurse or a doctor, and the infusion time must not be less than 15 minutes. On the day of treatment the patient should eat and drink normally, which includes drinking at least 2 glasses of fluid such as water within a few hours prior to the infusion, as directed by their doctor, before receiving zoledronic acid injection. After getting zoledronic acid injection it is strongly recommended patients with Paget   s disease take calcium in divided doses (for example, 2 to 4 times a day) for a total of 15  mg calcium a day to prevent low blood calcium levels. This is especially important for the two weeks after getting zoledronic acid injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake is important in patients with osteoporosis and the current recommended daily intake of calcium is 12  mg and vitamin D is 8  international units     1  international units daily. All patients should be instructed on the importance of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in maintaining serum calcium levels. Patients should be aware of the most commonly associated side effects of therapy. Patients may experience one or more side effects that could include: fever, flu-like symptoms, myalgia, arthralgia, and headache. Most of these side effects occur within the first 3 days following the dose of zoledronic acid injection. They usually resolve within 3 days of onset but may last for up to 7 to 14 days. Patients should consult their physician if they have questions or if these symptoms persist. The incidence of these symptoms decreased markedly with subsequent doses of zoledronic acid injection. Administration of acetaminophen following zoledronic acid injection administration may reduce the incidence of these symptoms. Physicians should inform their patients that there have been reports of persistent pain and/or a non-healing sore of the mouth or jaw, primarily in patients treated with bisphosphonates for other illnesses. During treatment with zoledronic acid, patients should be instructed to maintain good oral hygiene and undergo routine dental check-ups.  If they experience these symptoms, they should inform their physician or dentist. Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain have been infrequently reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid injection. Consider withholding future zoledronic acid injection treatment if severe symptoms develop. Atypical femur fractures in patients on bisphosphonate therapy have been reported; patients with thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture.

You may experience sadness and anger. A good place to start managing the disease is working with your doctor to determine the best treatment plan and taking your medications as prescribed. But keep in mind, many people with lupus live wonderfully happy lives, and therefore a positive outlook is very important. You can do several things to help you live with lupus: Learn to recognize the warning signs of a flare so that you and your doctor might reduce or prevent them. Warning signs include: Increased tiredness. Joint swelling. Pain. Rash. Fever. Abdominal pain. Headache. Eat a healthy well-balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Exercise to help keep your body strong; however, talk to your doctor before starting an exercise program. If you smoke, quit. This will help lower your risk for heart disease that can be a complication of lupus. Protect yourself from the sun sometimes, exposure to the sun can cause a flare. Wear protective clothing, such as a hat or long-sleeved shirts, and use sunscreen any time you go outside. Reach out to online and community support groups. Keep the lines of communication open. Talk to your family and friends about your lupus to help them understand the disease. Ask for help when you need it.

Pregnancy and Contraception for Women With Lupus  Most women with lupus can have healthy pregnancies if the disease is under control. If you start to plan a pregnancy, talk to your doctor so you can be as healthy as possible before becoming pregnant. Close monitoring during pregnancy is essential, especially if you have low platelets, antiphospholipid antibodies, anti-SSA/Ro antibodies, high blood pressure, lung or heart problems, or kidney disease. It is important to find an obstetrician who manages high-risk pregnancies and has experience working with women who have lupus. Research shows that birth control pills do not increase the risk for severe flares among women with lupus, but estrogen-containing pills are not recommended for women with antiphospholipid antibodies.

                "article": "Summary : A suprapubic catheter (tube) drains urine from your bladder. It is inserted into your bladder through a small hole in your belly. You may need a catheter because you have urinary incontinence (leakage), urinary retention (not being able to urinate), surgery that made a catheter necessary, or another health problem. What to Expect at Home : Your catheter will make it easier for you to drain your bladder and avoid infections. You will need to make sure it is working properly. You will also need to know how to change it. You will need to change it every 4 to 6 weeks. You can learn how to change your catheter in a sterile (very clean) way. After some practice, it will get easier. Your health care provider will change it for you the first time. Sometimes family members, a nurse, or others may be able to help you change your catheter. You will get a prescription to buy special catheters at a medical supply store. Other supplies you will need are sterile gloves, a catheter pack, syringes, sterile solution to clean with, gel such as K-Y Jelly or Surgilube (DO NOT use Vaseline), and a drainage bag. You may also get medicine for your bladder. Drink 8 to 12 glasses of water every day for a few days after you change your catheter. Avoid physical activity for a week or two. It is best to keep the catheter taped to your belly. Once your catheter is in place, you will need to empty your urine bag only a few times a day. Caring for Your Skin Near your Catheter : Follow these guidelines for good health and skin care. Check the catheter site a few times a day. Check for redness, pain, swelling, or pus. Wash the area around your catheter every day with mild soap and water. Gently pat it dry. Showers are fine. Ask your providers about bathtubs, swimming pools, and hot tubs. DO NOT use creams, powders, or sprays near the site. Apply bandages around the site the way your provider showed you. Make Sure Your Catheter Is Working : You will need to check your catheter and bag throughout the day. Make sure your bag is always below your waist. This will keep urine from going back into your bladder. Try not to disconnect the catheter more than you need to. Keeping it connected will make it work better. Check for kinks, and move the tubing around if it is not draining. Changing Your Catheter : You will need to change the catheter about every 4 to 6 weeks. Always wash your hands with soap and water before changing it. Once you have your sterile supplies ready, lie down on your back. Put on two pairs of sterile gloves, one over the other. Then. Make sure your new catheter is lubricated on the end you will insert into your belly. Clean around the site using a sterile solution. Deflate the balloon with one of the syringes. Take out the old catheter slowly. Take off the top pair of gloves. Insert the new catheter as far in as the other one was placed. Wait for urine to flow. It may take a few minutes. Inflate the balloon using 5 to 8 ml of sterile water. Attach your drainage bag. If you are having trouble changing your catheter, call your doctor right away. Insert a catheter into your urethra through your urinary opening in your labia (women) or penis (men) to pass urine. DO NOT remove the suprapubic catheter because the hole can close up quickly. However, if you have removed the catheter already and cannot get it back in, call your provider or go to the local emergency room. When to Call the Doctor : Call your health care provider if. You are having trouble changing your catheter or emptying your bag. Your bag is filling up quickly, and you have an increase in urine. You are leaking urine. You notice blood in your urine a few days after you leave the hospital. You are bleeding at the insertion site after you change your catheter, and it does not stop within 24 hours. Your catheter seems blocked. You notice grit or stones in your urine. Your supplies do not seem to be working (balloon is not inflating or other problems). You notice a smell or change in color in your urine, or your urine is cloudy. You have signs of infection (a burning sensation when you urinate, fever, or chills). Alternate Names : SPT",

However, life-threatening conditions, such as colon cancer or early appendicitis, may only cause mild pain or no pain. Other ways to describe pain in your abdomen include. Generalized pain: This means that you feel it in more than half of your belly. This type of pain is more typical for a stomach virus, indigestion, or gas. If the pain becomes more severe, it may be caused by a blockage of the intestines. Localized pain: This is pain found in only one area of your belly. It is more likely to be a sign of a problem in an organ, such as the appendix, gallbladder, or stomach. Cramp-like pain: This type of pain is not serious most of the time. It is likely to be due to gas and bloating, and is often followed by diarrhea. More worrisome signs include pain that occurs more often, lasts than 24 hours, or occurs with a fever. Colicky pain: This type of pain comes in waves. It very often starts and ends suddenly, and is often severe. Kidney stones and gallstones are common causes of this type of belly pain.",

If you have depression, you may have experienced it when you were younger, and may have a family history of the illness. You may also be going through difficult life events, such as physical or psychological trauma, losing a loved one, a difficult relationship with a family member or friend, or financial troubles. Any of these stressful experiences can lead to depression. For older adults who experience depression for the first time later in life, other factors may be at play. Depression may be related to changes that occur in the brain and body as a person ages. For example, some older adults who are at risk for illnesses such as heart disease or stroke may have hardening and inflammation of the blood vessels, and blood may not be able to flow normally to the body's organs, including the brain. Over time, this blood vessel disease and restricted blood flow can damage nearby brain tissue and harm the nerve connections that help different parts of the brain communicate with each other. If this happens, an older adult with no family history of depression may develop what some doctors call \"vascular depression.\" Older adults may also experience depression as a result of brain changes caused by illnesses such as Alzheimers disease or Parkinsons disease.

It causes severe symptoms that affect how you feel, think, and handle daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working. To be diagnosed with depression, the symptoms must be present for at least two weeks. Some forms of depression are slightly different, or they may develop under unique circumstances, such as: Persistent depressive disorder (also called dysthymia) is a depressed mood that lasts for at least two years. A person diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder may have episodes of major depression along with periods of less severe symptoms, but symptoms must last for two years to be considered persistent depressive disorder. Postpartum depression is much more serious than the baby blues (relatively mild depressive and anxiety symptoms that typically clear within two weeks after delivery) that many women experience after giving birth. Women with postpartum depression experience full-blown major depression during pregnancy or after delivery (postpartum depression). The feelings of extreme sadness, anxiety, and exhaustion that accompany postpartum depression may make it difficult for these new mothers to complete daily care activities for themselves and/or for their babies. Psychotic depression occurs when a person has severe depression plus some form of psychosis, such as having disturbing false fixed beliefs (delusions) or hearing or seeing upsetting things that others cannot hear or see (hallucinations). The psychotic symptoms typically have a depressive theme, such as delusions of guilt, poverty, or illness. Seasonal affective disorder is characterized by the onset of depression during the winter months, when there is less natural sunlight. This depression generally lifts during spring and summer. Winter depression, typically accompanied by social withdrawal, increased sleep, and weight gain, predictably returns every year in seasonal affective disorder. Bipolar disorder is different from depression, but it is included in this list is because someone with bipolar disorder experiences episodes of extremely low moods that meet the criteria for major depression (called bipolar depression). But a person with bipolar disorder also experiences extreme high euphoric or irritable moods called mania or a less severe form called hypomania. Examples of other types of depressive disorders newly added to the diagnostic classification of DSM-5 include disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (diagnosed in children and adolescents) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).",

                "article": " Summary   What is cholesterol?  Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that's found in all the cells in your body. Your liver makes cholesterol, and it is also in some foods, such as meat and dairy products. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But if you have too much cholesterol in your blood, you have a higher risk of coronary artery disease.  How do you measure cholesterol levels?  A blood test called a lipoprotein panel can measure your cholesterol levels. Before the test, you'll need to fast (not eat or drink anything but water) for 9 to 12 hours. The test gives information about your Total cholesterol - a measure of the total amount of cholesterol in your blood. It includes both low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. LDL (bad) cholesterol - the main source of cholesterol buildup and blockage in the arteries HDL (good) cholesterol. HDL helps remove cholesterol from your arteries Non-HDL - this number is your total cholesterol minus your HDL. Your non-HDL includes LDL and other types of cholesterol such as VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein). Triglycerides - another form of fat in your blood that can raise your risk for heart disease, especially in women  What do my cholesterol numbers mean?  Cholesterol numbers are measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Here are the healthy levels of cholesterol, based on your age and gender:  Anyone age 19 or younger:  Type of Cholesterol Healthy Level Total Cholesterol Less than 17 /dL Non-HDL Less than 12 /dL LDL Less than 1 /dL HDL More than 45mg/dL  Men age 20 or older:  Type of Cholesterol Healthy Level Total Cholesterol 125 to 2 /dL Non-HDL Less than 13 /dL LDL Less than 1 /dL HDL 4 /dL or higher  Women age 20 or older:  Type of Cholesterol Healthy Level Total Cholesterol 125 to 2 /dL Non-HDL Less than 13 /dL LDL Less than 1 /dL HDL 5 /dL or higher Triglycerides are not a type of cholesterol, but they are part of a lipoprotein panel (the test that measures cholesterol levels). A normal triglyceride level is below 150 mg/dL. You might need treatment if you have triglyceride levels that are borderline high (150-199 mg/dL) or high (2  mg/dL or more).  How often should I get a cholesterol test?  When and how often you should get a cholesterol test depends on your age, risk factors, and family history. The general recommendations are:  For people who are age 19 or younger:  The first test should be between ages 9 to 11 Children should have the test again every 5 years Some children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high blood cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke  For people who are age 20 or older:  Younger adults should have the test every 5 years Men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 years  What affects my cholesterol levels?  A variety of things can affect cholesterol levels. These are some things you can do to lower your cholesterol levels: Diet. Saturated fat and cholesterol in the food you eat make your blood cholesterol level rise. Saturated fat is the main problem, but cholesterol in foods also matters. Reducing the amount of saturated fat in your diet helps lower your blood cholesterol level. Foods that have high levels of saturated fats include some meats, dairy products, chocolate, baked goods, and deep-fried and processed foods. Weight. Being overweight is a risk factor for heart disease. It also tends to increase your cholesterol. Losing weight can help lower your LDL (bad) cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. It also raises your HDL (good) cholesterol level. Physical Activity. Not being physically active is a risk factor for heart disease. Regular physical activity can help lower LDL (bad) cholesterol and raise HDL (good) cholesterol levels. It also helps you lose weight. You should try to be physically active for 30 minutes on most, if not all, days. Smoking. Cigarette smoking lowers your HDL (good) cholesterol. HDL helps to remove bad cholesterol from your arteries. So a lower HDL can contribute to a higher level of bad cholesterol. Things outside of your control that can also affect cholesterol levels include: Age and Gender. As women and men get older, their cholesterol levels rise. Before the age of menopause, women have lower total cholesterol levels than men of the same age. After the age of menopause, women's LDL (bad) cholesterol levels tend to rise. Heredity. Your genes partly determine how much cholesterol your body makes. High blood cholesterol can run in families. Race. Certain races may have an increased risk of high blood cholesterol. For example, African Americans typically have higher HDL and LDL cholesterol levels than whites.  How can I lower my cholesterol?  There are two main ways to lower your cholesterol: Heart-healthy lifestyle changes, which include:   Heart-healthy eating. A heart-healthy eating plan limits the amount of saturated and trans fats that you eat. Examples include the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet and the DASH Eating Plan. Weight Management. If you are overweight, losing weight can help lower your LDL (bad) cholesterol. Physical Activity. Everyone should get regular physical activity (30 minutes on most, if not all, days). Managing stress. Research has shown that chronic stress can sometimes raise your LDL cholesterol and lower your HDL cholesterol. Quitting smoking. Quitting smoking can raise your HDL cholesterol. Since HDL helps to remove LDL cholesterol from your arteries, having more HDL can help to lower your LDL cholesterol.  Drug Treatment. If lifestyle changes alone do not lower your cholesterol enough, you may also need to take medicines. There are several types of cholesterol medicines available, including statins. The medicines work in different ways and can have different side effects. Talk to your health care provider about which one is right for you. While you are taking medicines to lower your cholesterol, you should continue with the lifestyle changes.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",

                "article": " Summary   What is cholesterol?  Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But if you have too much in your blood, it can stick to the walls of your arteries and narrow or even block them. This puts you at risk for coronary artery disease and other heart diseases. Cholesterol travels through the blood on proteins called lipoproteins. One type, LDL, is sometimes called the \"bad\" cholesterol. A high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. Another type, HDL, is sometimes called the \"good\" cholesterol. It carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Then your liver removes the cholesterol from your body.  What are the treatments for high cholesterol?  If you have high cholesterol, lifestyle changes can help you to lower your cholesterol level. But sometimes the lifestyle changes are not enough, and you need to take cholesterol medicines. You should still continue with the lifestyle changes even though you are taking medicines.  Who needs cholesterol medicines?  Your health care provider may prescribe medicine if: You have already had a heart attack or stroke, or you have peripheral arterial disease Your LDL (bad) cholesterol level is 190 mg/dL or higher You are 40-75 years old, you have diabetes, and your LDL cholesterol level is 70 mg/dL or higher You are 40-75 years old, you have a high risk of developing heart disease or stroke, and your LDL cholesterol level is 70 mg/dL or higher  What are the different types of medicines for cholesterol?  There are several types of cholesterol-lowering drugs available, including Statins, which block the liver from making cholesterol Bile acid sequestrants, which decrease the amount of fat absorbed from food Cholesterol absorption inhibitors, which decrease the amount of cholesterol absorbed from food and lower triglycerides. Nicotinic acid (niacin), which lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglycerides and raises HDL (good) cholesterol. Even though you can buy niacin without a prescription, you should talk to your health care provider before taking it to lower your cholesterol. High doses of niacin can cause serious side effects. PCSK9 inhibitors, which block a protein called PCSK9. This helps your liver remove and clear LDL cholesterol from your blood. Fibrates, which lower triglycerides. They may also raise HDL (good) cholesterol. If you take them with statins, they may increase the risk of muscle problems. Combination medicines, which include more than one type of cholesterol-lowering medicine There are also a few other cholesterol medicines (lomitapide and mipomersen) that are only for people who have familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). FH is an inherited disorder that causes high LDL cholesterol.  How does my health care provider decide which cholesterol medicine I should take?  When deciding which medicine you should take and which dose you need, your health care provider will consider Your cholesterol levels Your risk for heart disease and stroke Your age Any other health problems you have Possible side effects of the medicines. Higher doses are more likely to cause side effects, especially over time. Medicines can help control your cholesterol, but they don't cure it. You need to keep taking your medicines and get regular cholesterol checks to make sure that you cholesterol levels are in a healthy range.",

                "article": "Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia is a rare blood cell cancer characterized by an excess of abnormal white blood cells called lymphoplasmacytic cells in the bone marrow. This condition is classified as a lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. The abnormal cells have characteristics of both white blood cells (lymphocytes) called B cells and of more mature cells derived from B cells known as plasma cells. These abnormal cells produce excess amounts of IgM, a type of protein known as an immunoglobulin; the overproduction of this large protein is how the condition got its name (\"macroglobulinemia\").Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia usually begins in a person's sixties and is a slow-growing (indolent) cancer. Some affected individuals have elevated levels of IgM and lymphoplasmacytic cells but no symptoms of the condition; in these cases, the disease is usually found incidentally by a blood test taken for another reason. These individuals are diagnosed with smoldering (or asymptomatic) Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia. It can be several years before this form of the condition progresses to the symptomatic form.Individuals with symptomatic Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia can experience general symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Several other signs and symptoms of the condition are related to the excess IgM, which can thicken blood and impair circulation, causing a condition known as hyperviscosity syndrome. Features related to hyperviscosity syndrome include bleeding in the nose or mouth, blurring or loss of vision, headache, dizziness, and difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia). In some affected individuals, the IgM proteins clump together in the hands and feet, where the body temperature is cooler than at the center of the body. These proteins are then referred to as cryoglobulins, and their clumping causes a condition known as cryoglobulinemia. Cryoglobulinemia can lead to pain in the hands and feet or episodes of Raynaud phenomenon, in which the fingers and toes turn white or blue in response to cold temperatures. The IgM protein can also build up in organs such as the heart and kidneys, causing a condition called amyloidosis, which can lead to heart and kidney problems. Some people with Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia develop a loss of sensation and weakness in the limbs (peripheral neuropathy). Doctors are unsure why this feature occurs, although they speculate that the IgM protein attaches to the protective covering of nerve cells (myelin) and breaks it down. The damaged nerves cannot carry signals normally, leading to neuropathy.Other features of Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia are due to the accumulation of lymphoplasmacytic cells in different tissues. For example, accumulation of these cells can lead to an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), spleen (splenomegaly), or lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy). In the bone marrow, the lymphoplasmacytic cells interfere with normal blood cell development, causing a shortage of normal blood cells (pancytopenia). Excessive tiredness (fatigue) due to a reduction in red blood cells (anemia) is common in affected individuals.People with Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia have an increased risk of developing other cancers of the blood or other tissues.",

The occurrence of specific mutations in a specific gene,  MYD88 , commonly occur among patients with macroglobulinemia.Doctors may do other laboratory tests as well. For example, doctors may check a blood sample to determine if the numbers of red and white blood cells and platelets are normal. In addition, serum viscosity, which is a test to check the thickness of the blood, is often done. Blood clotting test results may be abnormal, and other tests may detect cryoglobulins. An examination of a urine sample may show Bence Jones proteins (pieces of abnormal antibodies). A bone marrow biopsy may reveal an increased number of lymphocytes and plasma cells, which helps confirm the diagnosis of macroglobulinemia, and the appearance of these cells helps differentiate this disorder from multiple myeloma.X-rays may show a loss of bone density (osteoporosis).

The most common known genetic change associated with this condition is a mutation in the MYD88 gene, which is found in more than 90 percent of affected individuals. Another gene commonly associated with Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia, CXCR4, is mutated in approximately 30 percent of affected individuals (most of whom also have the MYD88 gene mutation). Other genetic changes believed to be involved in Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia have not yet been identified. Studies have found that certain regions of DNA are deleted or added in some people with the condition; however, researchers are unsure which genes in these regions are important for development of the condition. The mutations that cause Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in the abnormal blood cells.The proteins produced from the MYD88 and CXCR4 genes are both involved in signaling within cells. The MyD88 protein relays signals that help prevent the self-destruction (apoptosis) of cells, thus aiding in cell survival. The CXCR4 protein stimulates signaling pathways inside the cell that help regulate cell growth and division (proliferation) and cell survival. Mutations in these genes lead to production of proteins that are constantly functioning (overactive). Excessive signaling through these overactive proteins allows survival and proliferation of abnormal cells that should undergo apoptosis, which likely contributes to the accumulation of lymphoplasmacytic cells in Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia.",

These symptoms include bleeding from the skin and mucous membranes (such as the lining of the mouth, nose, and digestive tract), fatigue, weakness, headache, confusion, dizziness, and even coma. The thickened blood also may worsen heart conditions and cause increased pressure in the brain. Tiny blood vessels in the back of the eyes can become filled with blood and may bleed, resulting in damage to the retina and impaired eyesight.People who have macroglobulinemia may also have swollen lymph nodes and an enlarged liver and spleen due to infiltration by cancerous plasma cells. Recurring bacterial infections resulting from inadequate production of normal antibodies may cause fever and chills. Anemia, which may result in weakness and fatigue, occurs when cancerous plasma cells prevent production of normal blood-forming cells in the bone marrow. Infiltration of bones by cancerous plasma cells may cause loss of bone density (osteoporosis), which can weaken bones and increase the risk of fractures.Some people develop a condition called cryoglobulinemia. Cryoglobulinemia involves the development of antibodies that clog up the blood vessels in cold temperatures.What Is Cryoglobulinemia? Cryoglobulins are abnormal antibodies produced by plasma cells and dissolved in the blood. When cooled below normal body temperature, cryoglobulins form large collections of solid particles (precipitates). When warmed to normal body temperature, they re-dissolve. The formation of cryoglobulins (cryoglobulinemia) is uncommon. In most instances, an underlying disorder causes people to form cryoglobulins. These disorders include cancers such as macroglobulinemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), and infections by such organisms as hepatitis C virus. Rarely, a cause for the formation of cryoglobulins cannot be found. Precipitates of cryoglobulins can trigger inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis), which causes various symptoms, such as bruises, joint aches, and weakness. The vasculitis may damage the liver and kidneys. In some people, the damage may progress to liver failure and kidney failure and can be fatal. People with cryoglobulinemia may also be very sensitive to cold or develop Raynaud syndrome, in which the hands and feet become very painful and turn white when chilled. Avoiding cold temperatures helps prevent vasculitis. Treating the underlying disorder may reduce the formation of cryoglobulins. For example, using interferon alpha to treat hepatitis C virus infection helps reduce formation of cryoglobulins. Removal of a large amount of plasma (the liquid part of blood) plus plasma transfusions (plasma exchange) may help, especially when combined with interferon.",

It is a disease that destroys your sharp, central vision. You need central vision to see objects clearly and to do tasks such as reading and driving. AMD affects the macula, the part of the eye that allows you to see fine detail. It does not hurt, but it causes cells in the macula to die. There are two types: wet and dry. Wet AMD happens when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula. These new blood vessels often leak blood and fluid. Wet AMD damages the macula quickly. Blurred vision is a common early symptom. Dry AMD happens when the light-sensitive cells in the macula slowly break down. Your gradually lose your central vision. A common early symptom is that straight lines appear crooked. Regular comprehensive eye exams can detect macular degeneration before the disease causes vision loss. Treatment can slow vision loss. It does not restore vision. NIH: National Eye Institute",

Distorted vision and vision loss usually become noticeable in a person's sixties or seventies and tend to worsen over time.Age-related macular degeneration mainly affects central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. The vision loss in this condition results from a gradual deterioration of light-sensing cells in the tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color (the retina). Specifically, age-related macular degeneration affects a small area near the center of the retina, called the macula, which is responsible for central vision. Side (peripheral) vision and night vision are generally not affected, but slow adjustment of vision to darkness (dark adaptation) and reduced dim light (scotopic) vision often occur in the early stages of the disease.Researchers have described two major types of age-related macular degeneration, known as the dry form and the wet form. The dry form is much more common, accounting for 85 to 90 percent of all cases of age-related macular degeneration. It is characterized by a buildup of yellowish deposits called drusen beneath the retina and vision loss that worsens slowly over time. The most advanced stage of dry age-related macular degeneration is known as geographic atrophy, in which areas of the macula waste away (atrophy), resulting in severe vision loss. Dry age-related macular degeneration typically affects vision in both eyes, although vision loss often occurs in one eye before the other.In 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals, the dry form progresses to the wet form of age-related macular degeneration. The wet form is characterized by the growth of abnormal, fragile blood vessels underneath the macula. These vessels leak blood and fluid, which damages the macula and makes central vision appear blurry and distorted. The wet form of age-related macular degeneration is associated with severe vision loss that can worsen rapidly.",

                "article": "Type 1 diabetes is caused by a lack of insulin due to the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. In type 1 diabetesan autoimmune diseasethe bodys immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells. Normally, the immune system protects the body from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. But in autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks the bodys own cells. In type 1 diabetes, beta cell destruction may take place over several years, but symptoms of the disease usually develop over a short period of time. Type 1 diabetes typically occurs in children and young adults, though it can appear at any age. In the past, type 1 diabetes was called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) may be a slowly developing kind of type 1 diabetes. Diagnosis usually occurs after age 30. In LADA, as in type 1 diabetes, the bodys immune system destroys the beta cells. At the time of diagnosis, people with LADA may still produce their own insulin, but eventually most will need insulin shots or an insulin pump to control blood glucose levels. Genetic Susceptibility Heredity plays an important part in determining who is likely to develop type 1 diabetes. Genes are passed down from biological parent to child. Genes carry instructions for making proteins that are needed for the bodys cells to function. Many genes, as well as interactions among genes, are thought to influence susceptibility to and protection from type 1 diabetes. The key genes may vary in different population groups. Variations in genes that affect more than 1 percent of a population group are called gene variants. Certain gene variants that carry instructions for making proteins called human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) on white blood cells are linked to the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. The proteins produced by HLA genes help determine whether the immune system recognizes a cell as part of the body or as foreign material. Some combinations of HLA gene variants predict that a person will be at higher risk for type 1 diabetes, while other combinations are protective or have no effect on risk. While HLA genes are the major risk genes for type 1 diabetes, many additional risk genes or gene regions have been found. Not only can these genes help identify people at risk for type 1 diabetes, but they also provide important clues to help scientists better understand how the disease develops and identify potential targets for therapy and prevention. Genetic testing can show what types of HLA genes a person carries and can reveal other genes linked to diabetes. However, most genetic testing is done in a research setting and is not yet available to individuals. Scientists are studying how the results of genetic testing can be used to improve type 1 diabetes prevention or treatment. Autoimmune Destruction of Beta Cells In type 1 diabetes, white blood cells called T cells attack and destroy beta cells. The process begins well before diabetes symptoms appear and continues after diagnosis. Often, type 1 diabetes is not diagnosed until most beta cells have already been destroyed. At this point, a person needs daily insulin treatment to survive. Finding ways to modify or stop this autoimmune process and preserve beta cell function is a major focus of current scientific research. Recent research suggests insulin itself may be a key trigger of the immune attack on beta cells. The immune systems of people who are susceptible to developing type 1 diabetes respond to insulin as if it were a foreign substance, or antigen. To combat antigens, the body makes proteins called antibodies. Antibodies to insulin and other proteins produced by beta cells are found in people with type 1 diabetes. Researchers test for these antibodies to help identify people at increased risk of developing the disease. Testing the types and levels of antibodies in the blood can help determine whether a person has type 1 diabetes, LADA, or another type of diabetes. Environmental Factors Environmental factors, such as foods, viruses, and toxins, may play a role in the development of type 1 diabetes, but the exact nature of their role has not been determined. Some theories suggest that environmental factors trigger the autoimmune destruction of beta cells in people with a genetic susceptibility to diabetes. Other theories suggest that environmental factors play an ongoing role in diabetes, even after diagnosis. Viruses and infections. A virus cannot cause diabetes on its own, but people are sometimes diagnosed with type 1 diabetes during or after a viral infection, suggesting a link between the two. Also, the onset of type 1 diabetes occurs more frequently during the winter when viral infections are more common. Viruses possibly associated with type 1 diabetes include coxsackievirus B, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, rubella, and mumps. Scientists have described several ways these viruses may damage or destroy beta cells or possibly trigger an autoimmune response in susceptible people. For example, anti-islet antibodies have been found in patients with congenital rubella syndrome, and cytomegalovirus has been associated with significant beta cell damage and acute pancreatitisinflammation of the pancreas. Scientists are trying to identify a virus that can cause type 1 diabetes so that a vaccine might be developed to prevent the disease. Infant feeding practices. Some studies have suggested that dietary factors may raise or lower the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. For example, breastfed infants and infants receiving vitamin D supplements may have a reduced risk of developing type 1 diabetes, while early exposure to cows milk and cereal proteins may increase risk. More research is needed to clarify how infant nutrition affects the risk for type 1 diabetes.

                "article": "Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both.To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested and absorbed: A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body. An organ called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and other cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel. People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either: Their pancreas does not make enough insulin Their cells do not respond to insulin normally Both of the above There are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type: Type 1 diabetes is less common. It can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause of the failure to make enough insulin is unknown. Type 2 diabetes is more common. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease. Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn't use insulin as well as it should. Not all people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese. There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2. Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not already have diabetes.

                "article": "Type 2 diabetesthe most common form of diabetesis caused by a combination of factors, including insulin resistance, a condition in which the bodys muscle, fat, and liver cells do not use insulin effectively. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body can no longer produce enough insulin to compensate for the impaired ability to use insulin. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes may develop gradually and can be subtle; some people with type 2 diabetes remain undiagnosed for years. Type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older people who are also overweight or obese. The disease, once rare in youth, is becoming more common in overweight and obese children and adolescents. Scientists think genetic susceptibility and environmental factors are the most likely triggers of type 2 diabetes. Genetic Susceptibility Genes play a significant part in susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. Having certain genes or combinations of genes may increase or decrease a persons risk for developing the disease. The role of genes is suggested by the high rate of type 2 diabetes in families and identical twins and wide variations in diabetes prevalence by ethnicity. Type 2 diabetes occurs more frequently in African Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanics/Latinos, and some Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islander Americans than it does in non-Hispanic whites. Recent studies have combined genetic data from large numbers of people, accelerating the pace of gene discovery. Though scientists have now identified many gene variants that increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, the majority have yet to be discovered. The known genes appear to affect insulin production rather than insulin resistance. Researchers are working to identify additional gene variants and to learn how they interact with one another and with environmental factors to cause diabetes. Studies have shown that variants of the TCF7L2 gene increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. For people who inherit two copies of the variants, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is about 80 percent higher than for those who do not carry the gene variant.1 However, even in those with the variant, diet and physical activity leading to weight loss help delay diabetes, according to the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a major clinical trial involving people at high risk. Genes can also increase the risk of diabetes by increasing a persons tendency to become overweight or obese. One theory, known as the thrifty gene hypothesis, suggests certain genes increase the efficiency of metabolism to extract energy from food and store the energy for later use. This survival trait was advantageous for populations whose food supplies were scarce or unpredictable and could help keep people alive during famine. In modern times, however, when high-calorie foods are plentiful, such a trait can promote obesity and type 2 diabetes. Obesity and Physical Inactivity Physical inactivity and obesity are strongly associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. People who are genetically susceptible to type 2 diabetes are more vulnerable when these risk factors are present. An imbalance between caloric intake and physical activity can lead to obesity, which causes insulin resistance and is common in people with type 2 diabetes. Central obesity, in which a person has excess abdominal fat, is a major risk factor not only for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes but also for heart and blood vessel disease, also called cardiovascular disease (CVD). This excess belly fat produces hormones and other substances that can cause harmful, chronic effects in the body such as damage to blood vessels. The DPP and other studies show that millions of people can lower their risk for type 2 diabetes by making lifestyle changes and losing weight. The DPP proved that people with prediabetesat high risk of developing type 2 diabetescould sharply lower their risk by losing weight through regular physical activity and a diet low in fat and calories. In 2 , a follow-up study of DPP participantsthe Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS)showed that the benefits of weight loss lasted for at least 10 years after the original study began.2 Read more about the DPP, funded under National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical trial number NCT , and the DPPOS, funded under NIH clinical trial number NCT  in Diabetes Prevention Program. Insulin Resistance Insulin resistance is a common condition in people who are overweight or obese, have excess abdominal fat, and are not physically active. Muscle, fat, and liver cells stop responding properly to insulin, forcing the pancreas to compensate by producing extra insulin. As long as beta cells are able to produce enough insulin, blood glucose levels stay in the normal range. But when insulin production falters because of beta cell dysfunction, glucose levels rise, leading to prediabetes or diabetes. Abnormal Glucose Production by the Liver In some people with diabetes, an abnormal increase in glucose production by the liver also contributes to high blood glucose levels. Normally, the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon when blood glucose and insulin levels are low. Glucagon stimulates the liver to produce glucose and release it into the bloodstream. But when blood glucose and insulin levels are high after a meal, glucagon levels drop, and the liver stores excess glucose for later, when it is needed. For reasons not completely understood, in many people with diabetes, glucagon levels stay higher than needed. High glucagon levels cause the liver to produce unneeded glucose, which contributes to high blood glucose levels. Metformin, the most commonly used drug to treat type 2 diabetes, reduces glucose production by the liver. The Roles of Insulin and Glucagon in Normal Blood Glucose Regulation A healthy persons body keeps blood glucose levels in a normal range through several complex mechanisms. Insulin and glucagon, two hormones made in the pancreas, help regulate blood glucose levels. Insulin, made by beta cells, lowers elevated blood glucose levels. Glucagon, made by alpha cells, raises low blood glucose levels. Insulin helps muscle, fat, and liver cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream, lowering blood glucose levels. Insulin stimulates the liver and muscle tissue to store excess glucose. The stored form of glucose is called glycogen. Insulin also lowers blood glucose levels by reducing glucose production in the liver. Glucagon signals the liver and muscle tissue to break down glycogen into glucose, which enters the bloodstream and raises blood glucose levels. If the body needs more glucose, glucagon stimulates the liver to make glucose from amino acids. Metabolic Syndrome Metabolic syndrome, also called insulin resistance syndrome, refers to a group of conditions common in people with insulin resistance, including - higher than normal blood glucose levels - increased waist size due to excess abdominal fat - high blood pressure - abnormal levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood Cell Signaling and Regulation Cells communicate through a complex network of molecular signaling pathways. For example, on cell surfaces, insulin receptor molecules capture, or bind, insulin molecules circulating in the bloodstream. This interaction between insulin and its receptor prompts the biochemical signals that enable the cells to absorb glucose from the blood and use it for energy. Problems in cell signaling systems can set off a chain reaction that leads to diabetes or other diseases. Many studies have focused on how insulin signals cells to communicate and regulate action. Researchers have identified proteins and pathways that transmit the insulin signal and have mapped interactions between insulin and body tissues, including the way insulin helps the liver control blood glucose levels. Researchers have also found that key signals also come from fat cells, which produce substances that cause inflammation and insulin resistance. This work holds the key to combating insulin resistance and diabetes. As scientists learn more about cell signaling systems involved in glucose regulation, they will have more opportunities to develop effective treatments. Beta Cell Dysfunction Scientists think beta cell dysfunction is a key contributor to type 2 diabetes. Beta cell impairment can cause inadequate or abnormal patterns of insulin release. Also, beta cells may be damaged by high blood glucose itself, a condition called glucose toxicity. Scientists have not determined the causes of beta cell dysfunction in most cases. Single gene defects lead to specific forms of diabetes called maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). The genes involved regulate insulin production in the beta cells. Although these forms of diabetes are rare, they provide clues as to how beta cell function may be affected by key regulatory factors. Other gene variants are involved in determining the number and function of beta cells. But these variants account for only a small percentage of type 2 diabetes cases. Malnutrition early in life is also being investigated as a cause of beta cell dysfunction. The metabolic environment of the developing fetus may also create a predisposition for diabetes later in life. Risk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes People who develop type 2 diabetes are more likely to have the following characteristics: - age 45 or older - overweight or obese - physically inactive - parent or sibling with diabetes - family background that is African American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, or Pacific Islander American - history of giving birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds - history of gestational diabetes - high blood pressure140/90 or aboveor being treated for high blood pressure - high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or good, cholesterol below 35 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or a triglyceride level above 250 mg/dL - polycystic ovary syndrome, also called PCOS - prediabetesan A1C level of 5.7 to 6.4 percent; a fasting plasma glucose test result of 1  mg/dL, called impaired fasting glucose; or a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test result of 14 , called impaired glucose tolerance - acanthosis nigricans, a condition associated with insulin resistance, characterized by a dark, velvety rash around the neck or armpits - history of CVD The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that testing to detect prediabetes and type 2 diabetes be considered in adults who are overweight or obese and have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes. In adults without these risk factors, testing should begin at age 45.",

                "article": "Other types of diabetes have a variety of possible causes. Genetic Mutations Affecting Beta Cells, Insulin, and Insulin Action Some relatively uncommon forms of diabetes known as monogenic diabetes are caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. These mutations are usually inherited, but sometimes the gene mutation occurs spontaneously. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by reducing beta cells ability to produce insulin. The most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) and MODY. NDM occurs in the first 6 months of life. MODY is usually found during adolescence or early adulthood but sometimes is not diagnosed until later in life. More information about NDM and MODY is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Monogenic Forms of Diabetes. Other rare genetic mutations can cause diabetes by damaging the quality of insulin the body produces or by causing abnormalities in insulin receptors. Other Genetic Diseases Diabetes occurs in people with Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and Turner syndrome at higher rates than the general population. Scientists are investigating whether genes that may predispose people to genetic syndromes also predispose them to diabetes. The genetic disorders cystic fibrosis and hemochromatosis are linked to diabetes. Cystic fibrosis produces abnormally thick mucus, which blocks the pancreas. The risk of diabetes increases with age in people with cystic fibrosis. Hemochromatosis causes the body to store too much iron. If the disorder is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs. Damage to or Removal of the Pancreas Pancreatitis, cancer, and trauma can all harm the pancreatic beta cells or impair insulin production, thus causing diabetes. If the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells. Endocrine Diseases Endocrine diseases affect organs that produce hormones. Cushings syndrome and acromegaly are examples of hormonal disorders that can cause prediabetes and diabetes by inducing insulin resistance. Cushings syndrome is marked by excessive production of cortisolsometimes called the stress hormone. Acromegaly occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone. Glucagonoma, a rare tumor of the pancreas, can also cause diabetes. The tumor causes the body to produce too much glucagon. Hyperthyroidism, a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, can also cause elevated blood glucose levels. Autoimmune Disorders Rare disorders characterized by antibodies that disrupt insulin action can lead to diabetes. This kind of diabetes is often associated with other autoimmune disorders such as lupus erythematosus. Another rare autoimmune disorder called stiff-man syndrome is associated with antibodies that attack the beta cells, similar to type 1 diabetes. Medications and Chemical Toxins Some medications, such as nicotinic acid and certain types of diuretics, anti-seizure drugs, psychiatric drugs, and drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can impair beta cells or disrupt insulin action. Pentamidine, a drug prescribed to treat a type of pneumonia, can increase the risk of pancreatitis, beta cell damage, and diabetes. Also, glucocorticoidssteroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisolmay impair insulin action. Glucocorticoids are used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, lupus, and ulcerative colitis. Many chemical toxins can damage or destroy beta cells in animals, but only a few have been linked to diabetes in humans. For example, dioxina contaminant of the herbicide Agent Orange, used during the Vietnam Warmay be linked to the development of type 2 diabetes. In 2 , based on a report from the Institute of Medicine, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) added diabetes to the list of conditions for which Vietnam veterans are eligible for disability compensation. Also, a chemical in a rat poison no longer in use has been shown to cause diabetes if ingested. Some studies suggest a high intake of nitrogen-containing chemicals such as nitrates and nitrites might increase the risk of diabetes. Arsenic has also been studied for possible links to diabetes. Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy is a condition in which fat tissue is lost or redistributed in the body. The condition is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",

        "multi_abs_summ": "Diabetes is  caused by high levels of blood sugar. The blood sugar levels are high either if  your body does not make insulin or it does not use insulin right. Insulin, a hormone produced in the pancreas, helps the glucose from food get into your body's cells for energy. There are two main types of diabetes, each with its own risk factors and potential causes. In diabetes type 1, the body makes little or no insulin.  Most likely, the cause is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system  attacks and destroys pancreatic cells that produce insulin. It can be triggered by an infection  or some medications. Some foods may raise  the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. For example,  early exposure to cows milk and cereals in infants may increase risk.  In type 2 diabetes, which is more common, the body is resistant to insulin, i.e., it is not used properly and the body can no longer produce enough insulin to compensate for the inability to use insulin.",
        "multi_ext_summ": "Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both.To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested and absorbed: A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body. An organ called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and other cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel. People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either: Their pancreas does not make enough insulin Their cells do not respond to insulin normally. There are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type: Type 1 diabetes is less common. It can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin stop working.  The exact cause of the failure to make enough insulin is unknown.  Most likely, it is an autoimmune disorder. This is a condition that occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue. With type 1 diabetes, an infection or another trigger causes the body to mistakenly attack the beta cells in the pancreas that make insulin. Some studies have suggested that dietary factors may raise or lower the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. For example, breastfed infants and infants receiving vitamin D supplements may have a reduced risk of developing type 1 diabetes, while early exposure to cows milk and cereal proteins may increase risk.  Some medications, such as nicotinic acid and certain types of diuretics, anti-seizure drugs, psychiatric drugs, and drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can impair beta cells or disrupt insulin action.  Type 2 diabetes is more common.  With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn't use insulin as well as it should. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body can no longer produce enough insulin to compensate for the impaired ability to use insulin.",

Orpha Number: 545 Definition Follicular lymphoma is a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (see this term) characterized by a proliferation of B cells whose nodular structure of follicular architecture is preserved. Epidemiology Prevalence of follicular lymphoma is estimated at about 1/3, . Clinical description The median age at diagnosis is 60-65 years. The disease is extremely rare in children. Follicular lymphoma is located primarily in the lymph nodes , but can also involve the spleen, bone marrow, peripheral blood and Waldeyer's ring. The skin and central nervous system are affected in rare cases. Symptoms appear at an advanced stage of the disease and can include fever, night sweats and weight loss. At diagnosis, patients usually present with adenopathy and, in 50% of cases, splenomegaly. Etiology In 85% of cases, follicular lymphomas are associated with a translocation t(14;18) (q32;q21), which activates the BCL2 gene encoding the BCL2 protein that is essential for some apoptosis processes. Diagnostic methods Diagnosis is based on histological analysis of the adenopathy, a complete blood count, measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and biopsy analysis of a lymph node. Examination using imagery (particularly a chest radiograph) is required. The observation of the translocation t(14;18) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in addition to suggested histological results, confirms the diagnosis. Differential diagnosis Differential diagnoses include chronic lymphocytic B cell leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and MALT lymphoma (see these terms). Management and treatment If the lymphoma is localized it should be treated by radiotherapy. In the case of advanced stage lymphoma, chemotherapy with immuno-chemotherapy should be offered (rituximab combined with CHOP). In cases of chemosensitive relapse, treatment can be intensified. Prognosis The survival rate at five years is 80-90% and medial survival is approximately 10-12 years. Visit the Orphanet disease page for more resources.",

                "article": "Many of the characteristic features of Angelman syndrome result from the loss of function of a gene called UBE3A. People normally inherit one copy of the UBE3A gene from each parent. Both copies of this gene are turned on (active) in many of the body's tissues. In certain areas of the brain, however, only the copy inherited from a person's mother (the maternal copy) is active. This parent-specific gene activation is caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting. If the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene is lost because of a chromosomal change or a gene mutation, a person will have no active copies of the gene in some parts of the brain.Several different genetic mechanisms can inactivate or delete the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene. Most cases of Angelman syndrome (about 70 percent) occur when a segment of the maternal chromosome 15 containing this gene is deleted. In other cases (about 11 percent), Angelman syndrome is caused by a mutation in the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene.In a small percentage of cases, Angelman syndrome results when a person inherits two copies of chromosome 15 from his or her father (paternal copies) instead of one copy from each parent. This phenomenon is called paternal uniparental disomy. Rarely, Angelman syndrome can also be caused by a chromosomal rearrangement called a translocation, or by a mutation or other defect in the region of DNA that controls activation of the UBE3A gene. These genetic changes can abnormally turn off (inactivate) UBE3A or other genes on the maternal copy of chromosome 15.The causes of Angelman syndrome are unknown in 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals. Changes involving other genes or chromosomes may be responsible for the disorder in these cases.In some people who have Angelman syndrome, the loss of a gene called OCA2 is associated with light-colored hair and fair skin. The OCA2 gene is located on the segment of chromosome 15 that is often deleted in people with this disorder. However, loss of the OCA2 gene does not cause the other signs and symptoms of Angelman syndrome. The protein produced from this gene helps determine the coloring (pigmentation) of the skin, hair, and eyes.",

The health care provider will also ask the patient about current and past medical conditions and medications.Physical ExamA physical exam may help diagnose ulcerative colitis. During a physical exam, the health care provider most oftenchecks for abdominal distension, or swelling listens to sounds within the abdomen using a stethoscope taps on the abdomen to check for tenderness and painLab TestsA health care provider may order lab tests to help diagnose ulcerative colitis, including blood and stool tests.Blood tests. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care provider's office or a lab. A lab technologist will analyze the blood sample. A health care provider may use blood tests to look foranemia inflammation or infection somewhere in the body markers that show ongoing inflammation low albumin, or proteincommon in patients with severe ulcerative colitisStool tests. A stool test is the analysis of a sample of stool. A health care provider will give the patient a container for catching and storing the stool at home. The patient returns the sample to the health care provider or to a lab. A lab technologist will analyze the stool sample. Health care providers commonly order stool tests to rule out other causes of GI diseases, such as infection.Endoscopies of the Large IntestineEndoscopies of the large intestine are the most accurate methods for diagnosing ulcerative colitis and ruling out other possible conditions, such as Crohn's disease, diverticular disease, or cancer. Endoscopies of the large intestine includeColonoscopy. Colonoscopy is a test that uses a long, flexible, narrow tube with a light and tiny camera on one end, called a colonoscope or scope, to look inside the rectum and entire colon. In most cases, light anesthesia and pain medication help patients relax for the test. The medical staff will monitor a patient's vital signs and try to make him or her as comfortable as possible. A nurse or technician places an intravenous (IV) needle in a vein in the patient's arm or hand to give anesthesia.For the test, the patient will lie on a table or stretcher while the gastroenterologist inserts a colonoscope into the patient's anus and slowly guides it through the rectum and into the colon. The scope inflates the large intestine with air to give the gastroenterologist a better view. The camera sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a monitor, allowing the gastroenterologist to carefully examine the tissues lining the colon and rectum. The gastroenterologist may move the patient several times and adjust the scope for better viewing. Once the scope has reached the opening to the small intestine, the gastroenterologist slowly withdraws it and examines the lining of the colon and rectum again.A colonoscopy can show irritated and swollen tissue, ulcers, and abnormal growths such as polypsextra pieces of tissue that grow on the inner lining of the intestine. If the gastroenterologist suspects ulcerative colitis, he or she will biopsy the patient's colon and rectum. A biopsy is a procedure that involves taking small pieces of tissue for examination with a microscope.A health care provider will give patients written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. The health care provider will also give patients information about how to care for themselves following the procedure.Flexible sigmoidoscopy. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is a test that uses a flexible, narrow tube with a light and tiny camera on one end, called a sigmoidoscope or scope, to look inside the rectum, the sigmoid colon, and sometimes the descending colon. In most cases, a patient does not need anesthesia.For the test, the patient will lie on a table or stretcher while the health care provider inserts the sigmoidoscope into the patient's anus and slowly guides it through the rectum, the sigmoid colon, and sometimes the descending colon.

                "article": "The treatment of knee problems depends on your type of injury or condition.  Arthritis in Knees  The most common type of arthritis of the knee is osteoarthritis. In this disease, the cartilage in your knee gradually wears away. Treatments for osteoarthritis are: Medicines to reduce pain, such as aspirin and acetaminophen. Medicines to reduce swelling and inflammation, such as ibuprofen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Injections of corticosteroids medications directly into the knee joint. Exercises to improve movement and strength. Weight loss to relieve the stress on the knee joint. Rheumatoid arthritis is another type of arthritis that affects the knee. In rheumatoid arthritis, your knee becomes inflamed and cartilage may be destroyed. Treatment includes: Physical therapy to strengthen the muscles. Weight loss to relieve the stress on the knee joint. Medicines similar to those prescribed for osteoarthritis. However, you may need additional medicines such as disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs or biologic response modifiers to control the disease. Knee for a seriously knee damage, which can include: Knee replacement. Cartilage replacement. Resurfacing the damaged cartilage. Treatment for other joint diseases is similar to the treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.  Chondromalacia  To treat chondromalacia, many doctors recommend that people with chondromalacia perform low-impact exercises such as: Swimming. Riding a stationary bicycle. Using a cross-country ski machine. These types of exercises strengthen muscles, particularly muscles of the inner part of the quadriceps, without injuring joints. If these treatments dont improve the condition, surgery may be indicated.  Injuries to the Menisci  If the tear is minor and the pain and other symptoms go away, the doctor may recommend a muscle-strengthening program. The following exercises are designed to build up the quadriceps and hamstring muscles and increase flexibility and strength after injury to the meniscus: Warming up the joint by riding a stationary bicycle, then straightening and raising the leg (but not straightening it too much). Extending the leg while sitting (a weight may be worn on the ankle for this exercise). Raising the leg while lying on the stomach. Exercising in a pool (walking as fast as possible in chest-deep water, performing small flutter kicks while holding onto the side of the pool, and raising each leg to 90 degrees in chest-deep water while pressing the back against the side of the pool). Before beginning any type of exercise program, consult your doctor or physical therapist to learn which exercises are appropriate for you and how to do them correctly. If you are doing the wrong exercise or exercising improperly, you can cause problems. A health care professional can also advise you on how to warm up safely and when to avoid exercising a joint affected by arthritis. If your lifestyle is limited by the symptoms or the problem, surgery may be indicated.  Cruciate Ligament Injuries  For an incomplete tear, your doctor may recommend an exercise program to strengthen surrounding muscles. He or she may also prescribe a brace to protect the knee during activity. For a completely torn anterior cruciate ligament in an active athlete and motivated person, your doctor is likely to recommend surgery.  Medial and Lateral Collateral Ligament Injuries  Most sprains of the collateral ligaments will heal if you: Follow a prescribed exercise program. Apply ice packs to reduce pain and swelling. Use a small sleeve-type brace to protect and stabilize the knee. A sprain may take 2 to 4 weeks to heal. A severely sprained or torn collateral ligament may be accompanied by a torn anterior cruciate ligament, which usually requires surgical repair.  Tendon Injuries and Disorders  Treatment for tendon injuries and disorders includes: Rest. Ice. Elevation. Medicines such as aspirin or ibuprofen to relieve pain and reduce swelling. Limiting sports activity. Exercise for stretching and strengthening. A cast, if there is a partial tear. Surgery for complete tears or very severe injuries. The goals of an exercise program for tendon injuries and disorder are: Restore the ability to bend and straighten the knee. Strengthen the knee to prevent repeat injury.  Osgood-Schlatter Disease  Osgood-Schlatter disease is temporary and the pain usually goes away without treatment, which includes: Applying ice to the knee when pain begins to help relieve inflammation. Stretching and strengthening exercises. Limiting participation in vigorous sports. Wearing knee pads for protection and apply ice to the knee after more intense activity. If there is a great deal of pain, sports activities may be limited until the discomfort becomes tolerable.  Iliotibial Band Syndrome  Iliotibial band syndrome usually disappears if you: Reduce your activity. Perform stretching exercises followed by muscle-strengthening exercises. In rare cases when the syndrome doesnt disappear, you may need surgery to split the tendon so it isnt stretched too tightly over the bone.  Osteochondritis Dissecans  Doctors treat osteochondritis dissecans with: Rest and limiting activity. Physical therapy. If conservative measures do not help or the cartilage fragments are loose, surgery may be recommended. Surgery can include: A surgeon placing a pin or screw. This can stimulate new blood flow to the cartilage. A surgeon may scrape the cavity to reach fresh bone and add a bone graft to fix the fragments in position. Research is being done to investigate cartilage and tissue transplants.  Plica Syndrome  The treatments for plica syndrome include: Medicines such as aspirin or ibuprofen to reduce swelling. Rest. Ice. Elastic bandage on the knee. Exercises to strengthen muscles. Cortisone injection into the plicae. You may need surgery to remove the plica if the other treatments do not fix the problem.

If knee pain is caused by an accident or injury, you should contact your health care provider.If your knee pain has just started and is not severe, you can: Rest and avoid activities that cause pain. Avoid putting weight on your knee. Apply ice. First, apply it every hour for up to 15 minutes. After the first day, apply it at least 4 times per day. Cover your knee with a towel before applying ice. DO NOT fall asleep while using ice. You can leave it on too long and get frostbite. Keep your knee raised as much as possible to bring down any swelling. Wear an elastic bandage or elastic sleeve, which you can buy at most pharmacies. This may reduce swelling and provide support. Take ibuprofen (Motrin) or naproxyn (Aleve) for pain and swelling. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) can help relieve pain, but not swelling. Talk to your provider before taking these medicines if you have medical problems, or if you have taken them for more than a day or two. Sleep with a pillow underneath or between your knees. Follow these general tips to help relieve and prevent knee pain: Always warm up before exercising and cool down after exercising. Stretch the muscles in the front of your thigh (quadriceps) and in the back of your thigh (hamstrings). Avoid running down hills -- walk down instead. Bicycle, or better yet, swim instead of run. Reduce the amount of exercise you do. Run on a smooth, soft surface, such as a track, instead of on cement or pavement. Lose weight if you are overweight. Every pound (0.5 kilogram) that you are overweight puts about 5 extra pounds (2.25 kilograms) of pressure on your kneecap when you go up and down stairs. Ask your provider for help losing weight. If you have flat feet, try special shoe inserts and arch supports (orthotics). Make sure your running shoes are well made, fit well, and have good cushioning.

Follow these general tips to help relieve and prevent knee pain: Always warm up before exercising and cool down after exercising. Stretch the muscles in the front of your thigh (quadriceps) and in the back of your thigh (hamstrings). Avoid running down hills -- walk down instead. Bicycle, or better yet, swim instead of run.  Run on a smooth, soft surface, such as a track, instead of on cement or pavement.   Wear shoes that fit properly and are in good condition. This will help maintain balance and leg alignment when walking or running. Flat feet or over-pronated feet (feet that roll inward) can cause knee problems. People can often reduce some of these problems by wearing special shoe inserts (orthotics)",

The painseldomlasts more than a few seconds or a minute or twoper episode. The intensity of pain can be physically and mentally incapacitating. TN pain is typically felt on one side of the jaw or cheek. Episodes can last for days, weeks, or months at a time and then disappear for months or years. In the days before an episode begins, some patients may experience a tingling or numbing sensation or a somewhat constant and aching pain. The attacks often worsen over time, with fewer and shorter pain-free periods before they recur. The intense flashes of pain can be triggered by vibration or contact with the cheek (such as when shaving, washing the face, or applying makeup), brushing teeth, eating, drinking, talking, or being exposed to the wind. TN occurs most often in people over age 50, but it can occur at any age, and is more common in women than in men. There is some evidence that the disorder runs in families, perhaps because of an inherited pattern of blood vessel formation. Although sometimes debilitating, the disorder is not life-threatening. The presumed cause of TN is a blood vessel pressing on the trigeminal nerve in the head as it exits the brainstem. TN may be part of the normal aging process but in some cases it is the associated with another disorder, such as multiple sclerosis or other disorders characterized by damage to the myelin sheath that covers certain nerves.",

People with type III are born with normal hearing and near-normal balance but develop vision problems and then hearing loss. There is no cure.

The major symptoms of Usher syndrome are hearing loss and an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa, or RP. Retinitis pigmentosa causes night-blindness and a loss of peripheral vision (side vision) through the progressive degeneration of the retina. The retina is a light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye and is crucial for vision. As retinitis pigmentosa progresses, the field of vision narrows, a condition known as    tunnel vision,    until only central vision (the ability to see straight ahead) remains.

                "article": "Usher syndrome is a condition characterized by hearing loss or deafness and progressive vision loss. The loss of vision is caused by an eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa (RP), which affects the layer of light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). Vision loss occurs as the light-sensing cells of the retina gradually deteriorate. Night vision loss begins first, followed by blind spots that develop in the side (peripheral) vision. Over time, these blind spots enlarge and merge to produce tunnel vision. In some cases of Usher syndrome, vision is further impaired by clouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts). Many people with retinitis pigmentosa retain some central vision throughout their lives, however. Researchers have identified three major types of Usher syndrome, designated as types I, II, and III. These types are distinguished by their severity and the age when signs and symptoms appear. Type I is further divided into seven distinct subtypes, designated as types IA through IG. Usher syndrome type II has at least three described subtypes, designated as types IIA, IIB, and IIC. Individuals with Usher syndrome type I are typically born completely deaf or lose most of their hearing within the first year of life. Progressive vision loss caused by retinitis pigmentosa becomes apparent in childhood. This type of Usher syndrome also includes problems with the inner ear that affect balance. As a result, children with the condition begin sitting independently and walking later than usual. Usher syndrome type II is characterized by hearing loss from birth and progressive vision loss that begins in adolescence or adulthood. The hearing loss associated with this form of Usher syndrome ranges from mild to severe and mainly affects high tones. Affected children have problems hearing high, soft speech sounds, such as those of the letters d and t. The degree of hearing loss varies within and among families with this condition. Unlike other forms of Usher syndrome, people with type II do not have difficulties with balance caused by inner ear problems. People with Usher syndrome type III experience progressive hearing loss and vision loss beginning in the first few decades of life. Unlike the other forms of Usher syndrome, infants with Usher syndrome type III are usually born with normal hearing. Hearing loss typically begins during late childhood or adolescence, after the development of speech, and progresses over time. By middle age, most affected individuals are profoundly deaf. Vision loss caused by retinitis pigmentosa also develops in late childhood or adolescence. People with Usher syndrome type III may also experience difficulties with balance due to inner ear problems. These problems vary among affected individuals, however.",

                "article": "Usher syndrome is inherited, which means that it is passed from parents to their children through genes. Genes are located in almost every cell of the body. Genes contain instructions that tell cells what to do. Each person inherits two copies of each gene, one from each parent. Sometimes genes are altered, or mutated. Mutated genes may cause cells to act differently than  expected. Usher syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The term autosomal means that the mutated gene is not located on either of the chromosomes that determine a person   s sex; in other words, both males and females can have the disorder and can pass along the disorder to a child. The word recessive means that to have Usher syndrome, an individual must receive a mutated form of the Usher syndrome gene from each parent. If a child has a mutation in one Usher syndrome gene but the other gene is normal, he or she is predicted to have normal vision and hearing. Individuals with a mutation in a gene that can cause an autosomal recessive disorder are called carriers, because they    carry    the gene with a mutation but show no symptoms of the disorder. If both parents are carriers of a mutated gene for Usher syndrome, they will have a one-in-four chance of having a child with Usher syndrome with each  birth. Usually, parents who have normal hearing and vision do not know if they are carriers of an Usher syndrome gene mutation. Currently, it is not possible to determine whether an individual who does not have a family history of Usher syndrome is a carrier. NIDCD scientists are hoping to change this, however, as they learn more about the genes responsible for Usher  syndrome.",

                "article": "There are three clinical types of Usher syndrome: type 1, type 2, and type 3. In the United States, types 1 and 2 are the most common types. Together, they account for approximately 90-95 percent of all cases of children who have Usher  syndrome. Type 1: Children with type 1 Usher syndrome are profoundly deaf at birth and have severe balance problems. Many of these individuals obtain little or no benefit from hearing aids. Parents should consult their doctor and other hearing health professionals as early as possible to determine the best communication method for their child. Intervention should be introduced early, during the first few years of life, so that the child can take advantage of the unique window of time during which the brain is most receptive to learning language, whether spoken or signed. If a child is diagnosed with type 1 Usher syndrome early on, before he or she loses the ability to see, that child is more likely to benefit from the full spectrum of intervention strategies that can help him or her participate more fully in life   s  activities. Because of the balance problems associated with type 1 Usher syndrome, children with this disorder are slow to sit without support and typically don   t walk independently before they are 18 months of age. These children usually begin to develop vision problems in early childhood, almost always by the time they reach 10 years of age. Visual problems most often begin with difficulty seeing at night, but tend to progress rapidly until the individual is completely  blind. Type 2: Children with type 2 Usher syndrome are born with moderate to severe hearing loss and normal balance. Although the severity of hearing loss varies, most of these children can benefit from hearing aids and communicate orally. The visual problems in type 2 Usher syndrome tend to progress more slowly than those in type 1, with the onset of retinitis pigmentosa often not apparent until the  teens. Type 3: Children with type 3 Usher syndrome have normal hearing at birth. Although most children with the disorder have normal to near-normal balance, some may develop balance problems later on. Hearing and sight worsen over time, but the rate at which they decline can vary from person to person, even within the same family. A person with type 3 Usher syndrome may develop hearing loss by the teens, and he or she will usually require hearing aids by mid- to late adulthood. Night blindness usually begins sometime during puberty. Blind spots appear by the late teens to early adulthood, and, by mid-adulthood, the individual is usually legally  blind.    Type 1 Type 2 Type 3 hearing profound deafness in both ears from birth moderate to severe hearing loss from birth normal at birth; progressive loss in childhood or early teens vision decreased night vision before age 10 decreased night vision begins in late childhood or teens varies in severity; night vision problems often begin in teens vestibular function (balance) balance problems from birth normal normal to near-normal, chance of later problems",

                "article": "Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) is one of the major forms of epidermolysis bullosa, a group of genetic conditions that cause the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily. Blisters and skin erosions form in response to minor injury or friction, such as rubbing or scratching. Researchers classify junctional epidermolysis bullosa into two main types: Herlitz JEB and non-Herlitz JEB. Although the types differ in severity, their features overlap significantly, and they can be caused by mutations in the same genes. Herlitz JEB is the more severe form of the condition. From birth or early infancy, affected individuals have blistering over large regions of the body. Blistering also affects the mucous membranes, such as the moist lining of the mouth and digestive tract, which can make it difficult to eat and digest food. As a result, many affected children have chronic malnutrition and slow growth. The extensive blistering leads to scarring and the formation of red, bumpy patches called granulation tissue. Granulation tissue bleeds easily and profusely, making affected infants susceptible to serious infections and loss of necessary proteins, minerals, and fluids. Additionally, a buildup of granulation tissue in the airway can lead to a weak, hoarse cry and difficulty breathing. Other complications of Herlitz JEB can include fusion of the fingers and toes, abnormalities of the fingernails and toenails, joint deformities (contractures) that restrict movement, and hair loss (alopecia). Because the signs and symptoms of Herlitz JEB are so severe, infants with this condition usually do not survive beyond the first year of life. The milder form of junctional epidermolysis bullosa is called non-Herlitz JEB. The blistering associated with non-Herlitz JEB may be limited to the hands, feet, knees, and elbows, and it often improves after the newborn period. Other characteristic features of this condition include alopecia, malformed fingernails and toenails, and irregular tooth enamel. Most affected individuals do not have extensive scarring or granulation tissue formation, so breathing difficulties and other severe complications are rare. Non-Herlitz JEB is typically associated with a normal lifespan.",

                "article": "The main goals of treatment are to: Preserve a high level of physical and social functioning. Maintain a good quality of life. To achieve these goals, doctors recommend treatments that: Reduce swelling. Maintain full movement in the affected joints. Relieve pain. Prevent, identify, and treat complications. Most children with juvenile arthritis need a combination of medication and other treatments to reach these goals.  Medications  /h3> Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and naproxen sodium are examples of NSAIDs. They are often the first type of medication doctors prescribe for juvenile arthritis. All NSAIDs work similarly by blocking substances called prostaglandins that add to inflammation and pain. However, each NSAID is a different chemical, and each has a slightly different effect on the body. For unknown reasons, some children seem to respond better to one NSAID than another. NSAIDs should only be used at the lowest dose possible for the shortest time needed. You can buy some NSAIDs over the counter, while several others, including a subclass called COX-2 inhibitors, need a prescription. All NSAIDs can have significant side effects, so consult your childs doctor before giving any of them. Your childs doctor should monitor your child if he or she takes NSAIDs regularly to control juvenile arthritis. Side effects of NSAIDs include stomach problems; skin rashes; high blood pressure; fluid retention; and liver, kidney, and heart problems. The longer a person uses NSAIDs, the more likely he or she is to have side effects, ranging from mild to serious. Many other medicines cannot be taken when a person is taking NSAIDs because NSAIDs alter the way the body uses or eliminates these other medicines. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). If NSAIDs do not relieve symptoms of your childs juvenile arthritis, the doctor may prescribe this type of medication. DMARDs slow the progression of juvenile arthritis, but because they may take weeks or months to relieve symptoms, they often are taken with an NSAID. Although there are many different types of DMARDs, many doctors prescribe one called methotrexate. Researchers have learned that methotrexate is safe and effective for some children with juvenile arthritis whose symptoms are not relieved by other medications. Because children only need small doses of methotrexate for relief of arthritis symptoms, potentially dangerous side effects rarely occur. The most serious complication can be liver damage, which a doctor can help prevent with regular blood tests and check-ups. Careful monitoring for side effects is important for people taking methotrexate. When side effects are noticed early, the doctor can reduce the dose and eliminate the side effects. Corticosteroids. If your child has very severe juvenile arthritis, stronger medicines may be needed to stop serious symptoms, such as inflammation of the sac around the heart (pericarditis). Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, may be added to the treatment plan to control severe symptoms. This medication can be given by IV (intravenous), mouth, or injection directly into a joint. Corticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatory medicines. Corticosteroids can interfere with your childs normal growth and can cause other side effects, such as a round face, weakened bones, and an increased chance of having infections. Once the medication controls severe symptoms, the doctor will reduce the dose gradually and, in time, stop it completely. It can be dangerous to stop taking corticosteroids suddenly. Carefully follow the doctors instructions about how to take or reduce the dose. For inflammation in one or just a few joints, injecting a corticosteroid compound into the affected joint or joints can often bring quick relief without the systemic side effects of oral or IV medication. Biologic agents. If your child has received little relief from other medications, he or she may be given one of a newer class of medications called biologic response modifiers, or biologic agents. These are based on compounds made by living cells. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors are biologic agents that work by blocking the actions of TNF, a naturally occurring protein in the body that helps cause inflammation. Other biologic agents block other inflammatory proteins, such as interleukin-1 or immune cells called T cells. Different biologics tend to work better for the different subtypes of the disease.  Other Treatments  /h3> Physical therapy. A regular, general exercise program is an important part of a childs treatment plan. Exercise can help to maintain muscle tone and preserve and recover the range of motion of the joints. A physiatrist (rehabilitation specialist) or a physical therapist can design an appropriate exercise program for your child. The specialist also may recommend using splints and other devices to help maintain normal bone and joint growth. Complementary and alternative therapies. Many adults seek alternative ways of treating arthritis, such as special diets, supplements, acupuncture, massage, or even magnetic jewelry or mattress pads. Research shows that increasing numbers of children are using alternative and complementary therapies as well. Although there is little research to support many alternative treatments, some people seem to benefit from them. If your childs doctor feels the approach has value and is not harmful, you can incorporate it into the treatment plan. However, do not neglect regular health care or treatment of serious symptoms. The main goals of treatment are to: Preserve a high level of physical and social functioning. Maintain a good quality of life. To achieve these goals, doctors recommend treatments that: Reduce swelling. Maintain full movement in the affected joints. Relieve pain. Prevent, identify, and treat complications.

The most serious complication can be liver damage, which a doctor can help prevent with regular blood tests and check-ups. Careful monitoring for side effects is important for people taking methotrexate. When side effects are noticed early, the doctor can reduce the dose and eliminate the side effects. Corticosteroids. If your child has very severe juvenile arthritis, stronger medicines may be needed to stop serious symptoms, such as inflammation of the sac around the heart (pericarditis). Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, may be added to the treatment plan to control severe symptoms. This medication can be given by IV (intravenous), mouth, or injection directly into a joint. Corticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatory medicines. Corticosteroids can interfere with your childs normal growth and can cause other side effects, such as a round face, weakened bones, and an increased chance of having infections. Once the medication controls severe symptoms, the doctor will reduce the dose gradually and, in time, stop it completely. It can be dangerous to stop taking corticosteroids suddenly. Carefully follow the doctors instructions about how to take or reduce the dose. For inflammation in one or just a few joints, injecting a corticosteroid compound into the affected joint or joints can often bring quick relief without the systemic side effects of oral or IV medication. Biologic agents. If your child has received little relief from other medications, he or she may be given one of a newer class of medications called biologic response modifiers, or biologic agents. These are based on compounds made by living cells. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors are biologic agents that work by blocking the actions of TNF, a naturally occurring protein in the body that helps cause inflammation. Other biologic agents block other inflammatory proteins, such as interleukin-1 or immune cells called T cells. Different biologics tend to work better for the different subtypes of the disease.  Other Treatments  /h3> Physical therapy. A regular, general exercise program is an important part of a childs treatment plan. Exercise can help to maintain muscle tone and preserve and recover the range of motion of the joints. A physiatrist (rehabilitation specialist) or a physical therapist can design an appropriate exercise program for your child. The specialist also may recommend using splints and other devices to help maintain normal bone and joint growth. Complementary and alternative therapies. Many adults seek alternative ways of treating arthritis, such as special diets, supplements, acupuncture, massage, or even magnetic jewelry or mattress pads. Research shows that increasing numbers of children are using alternative and complementary therapies as well. Although there is little research to support many alternative treatments, some people seem to benefit from them. If your childs doctor feels the approach has value and is not harmful, you can incorporate it into the treatment plan. However, do not neglect regular health care or treatment of serious symptoms. The main goals of treatment are to: Preserve a high level of physical and social functioning. Maintain a good quality of life. To achieve these goals, doctors recommend treatments that: Reduce swelling. Maintain full movement in the affected joints. Relieve pain. Prevent, identify, and treat complications. Most children with juvenile arthritis need a combination of medication and other treatments to reach these goals.  Medications  /h3> Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and naproxen sodium are examples of NSAIDs. They are often the first type of medication doctors prescribe for juvenile arthritis. All NSAIDs work similarly by blocking substances called prostaglandins that add to inflammation and pain. However, each NSAID is a different chemical, and each has a slightly different effect on the body. For unknown reasons, some children seem to respond better to one NSAID than another. NSAIDs should only be used at the lowest dose possible for the shortest time needed. You can buy some NSAIDs over the counter, while several others, including a subclass called COX-2 inhibitors, need a prescription. All NSAIDs can have significant side effects, so consult your childs doctor before giving any of them. Your childs doctor should monitor your child if he or she takes NSAIDs regularly to control juvenile arthritis. Side effects of NSAIDs include stomach problems; skin rashes; high blood pressure; fluid retention; and liver, kidney, and heart problems. The longer a person uses NSAIDs, the more likely he or she is to have side effects, ranging from mild to serious. Many other medicines cannot be taken when a person is taking NSAIDs because NSAIDs alter the way the body uses or eliminates these other medicines. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). If NSAIDs do not relieve symptoms of your childs juvenile arthritis, the doctor may prescribe this type of medication. DMARDs slow the progression of juvenile arthritis, but because they may take weeks or months to relieve symptoms, they often are taken with an NSAID. Although there are many different types of DMARDs, many doctors prescribe one called methotrexate. Researchers have learned that methotrexate is safe and effective for some children with juvenile arthritis whose symptoms are not relieved by other medications. Because children only need small doses of methotrexate for relief of arthritis symptoms, potentially dangerous side effects rarely occur. The most serious complication can be liver damage, which a doctor can help prevent with regular blood tests and check-ups. Careful monitoring for side effects is important for people taking methotrexate. When side effects are noticed early, the doctor can reduce the dose and eliminate the side effects. Corticosteroids.

Ideally, your childs care should be managed by a pediatric rheumatologist, who is a doctor who has been specially trained to treat the rheumatic diseases in children. However, many pediatricians and adult rheumatologists also treat children with juvenile arthritis. Because there are relatively few pediatric rheumatologists and they are mainly concentrated at major medical centers in metropolitan areas, children who live in smaller towns and rural areas may benefit from having a doctor in their town coordinate care through a pediatric rheumatologist. Many large medical centers now conduct outreach clinics, in which doctors and a supporting team travel from large cities to smaller towns for one or two days to treat local patients. Other members of your childs health care team may include: Physical therapist. This health professional can work with your child to develop a plan of exercises that will improve joint function and strengthen muscles without causing further harm to affected joints. Occupational therapist. This health professional can teach ways to protect joints, minimize pain, conserve energy, and exercise. Occupational therapists specialize in the upper extremities (hands, wrists, elbows, arms, shoulders, and neck). Counselor or psychologist.

It usually affects the big toe, but many other joints may be affected. Juvenile Arthritis is the term used to describe arthritis in children. Arthritis is caused by inflammation of the joints. Osteoarthritis usually comes with age and most often affects the fingers, knees, and hips. Sometimes osteoarthritis follows a joint injury. For example, you might have badly injured your knee when young and develop arthritis in your knee joint years later. Psoriatic Arthritis can occur in people who have psoriasis (scaly red and white skin patches). It affects the skin, joints, and areas where tissues attach to bone. Reactive Arthritis is pain or swelling in a joint that is caused by an infection in your body. You may also have red, swollen eyes and a swollen urinary tract.

It secretes digestive juices into the small intestine through a tube called the pancreatic duct. The pancreas also releases the hormones insulin and glucagon into the bloodstream. Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. It happens when digestive enzymes start digesting the pancreas itself. Pancreatitis can be acute or chronic. Either form is serious and can lead to complications. Acute pancreatitis occurs suddenly and usually goes away in a few days with treatment. It is often caused by gallstones. Common symptoms are severe pain in the upper abdomen, nausea, and vomiting. Treatment is usually a few days in the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids, antibiotics, and medicines to relieve pain. Chronic pancreatitis does not heal or improve. It gets worse over time and leads to permanent damage. The most common cause is heavy alcohol use. Other causes include cystic fibrosis and other inherited disorders, high levels of calcium or fats in the blood, some medicines, and autoimmune conditions. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and oily stools. Treatment may also be a few days in the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids, medicines to relieve pain, and nutritional support. After that, you may need to start taking enzymes and eat a special diet. It is also important to not smoke or drink alcohol. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",

Weight loss (bariatric) surgery frequently reduces sleep apnea and reverses symptoms in people who are very overweight (morbidly obese), but even people who lose a lot of weight as a result of surgery may not experience a significant decrease in sleep apnea and the associated symptoms.Heavy snorers and people who often choke in their sleep should not consume alcohol or take sleep aids, sedating antihistamines, or other drugs that cause drowsiness. Sleeping on the side or elevating the head of the bed can help reduce snoring. Special devices strapped on the back help prevent people from sleeping on their back. The various other devices and sprays marketed to reduce snoring may help simple snoring, but they have not been shown to relieve obstructive sleep apnea. There are several surgical procedures marketed for snoring as well, but there is little proof of how well they work and how long they are effective.People with obstructive sleep apnea, particularly those who have excessive daytime sleepiness, benefit most predictably from continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). With CPAP, people breathe through a face or nose mask connected to a device that provides a slightly higher pressure in the airway. This increased pressure props the throat open as the person breathes in. CPAP can be given with or without humidifying the delivered air. Close follow-up by a health care practitioner is needed during the first 2 weeks of use to ensure proper mask fit and provide appropriate encouragement as the person learns to sleep with the mask.Some people who use CPAP still have excessive daytime sleepiness. These people may benefit from taking modafinil, which is a mild stimulant used to treat daytime sleepiness in people with obstructive sleep apnea. Other drugs are also being tested for people with obstructive sleep apnea.Removable oral appliances, fitted by dentists, can help relieve obstructive sleep apnea (and snoring) in people with mild to moderate sleep apnea. These appliances, which are worn only while sleeping, help keep the airway open. Most appliances separate the jaws and push the lower jaw forward so the tongue cannot move backward to block the throat. Others hold the tongue forward.Upper airway stimulation is a procedure in which an implanted electrical device is used to activate one of the two 12th cranial nerves (hypoglossal nerve). This therapy can be successful in people with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea who are unable to tolerate CPAP therapy.Surgery of the head or neck as a treatment for sleep apnea is useful if there are enlarged tonsils or an obvious blockage of the upper airway by another structure. In children, surgery to remove the tonsils and adenoids is the most common treatment. This type of surgery usually relieves sleep apnea, particularly if the tonsils or adenoids are enlarged. Surgery is sometimes used in people without obvious blockage if no other treatments have worked. Another common procedure is a uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, in which tissue from around the upper airways (for example, the tonsils and adenoids) is removed. It is most often helpful in people who have mild sleep apnea. Other surgical procedures are sometimes used, but they have not been studied as thoroughly.",

                "article": "Espaol Sleep apnea (AP-ne-ah) is a common disorder in which you have one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep. Breathing pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes. They may occur 3  or more an hour. Typically, normal breathing then starts again, sometimes with a loud snort or choking sound. Sleep apnea usually is a chronic (ongoing) condition that disrupts your sleep. When your breathing pauses or becomes shallow, youll often move out of deep sleep and into light sleep. As a result, the quality of your sleep is poor, which makes you tired during the day. Sleep apnea is a leading cause of excessive daytime sleepiness. Overview Sleep apnea often goes undiagnosed. Doctors usually can't detect the condition during routine office visits. Also, no blood test can help diagnose the condition. Most people who have sleep apnea don't know they have it because it only occurs during sleep. A family member or bed partner might be the first to notice signs of sleep apnea. The most common type of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea. In this condition, the airway collapses or becomes blocked during sleep. This causes shallow breathing or breathing pauses. When you try to breathe, any air that squeezes past the blockage can cause loud snoring. Obstructive sleep apnea is more common in people who are overweight, but it can affect anyone. For example, small children who have enlarged tonsil tissues in their throats may have obstructive sleep apnea. The animation below shows how obstructive sleep apnea occurs. Click the \"start\" button to play the animation. Written and spoken explanations are provided with each frame. Use the buttons in the lower right corner to pause, restart, or replay the animation, or use the scroll bar below the buttons to move through the frames. The animation shows how the airway can collapse and block air flow to the lungs, causing sleep apnea. Central sleep apnea is a less common type of sleep apnea. This disorder occurs if the area of your brain that controls your breathing doesn't send the correct signals to your breathing muscles. As a result, you'll make no effort to breathe for brief periods. Central sleep apnea can affect anyone. However, it's more common in people who have certain medical conditions or use certain medicines. Central sleep apnea can occur with obstructive sleep apnea or alone. Snoring typically doesn't happen with central sleep apnea. This article mainly focuses on obstructive sleep apnea. Outlook Untreated sleep apnea can: Increase the risk of high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, obesity, and diabetes Increase the risk of, or worsen, heart failure Make arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), or irregular heartbeats, more likely Increase the chance of having work-related or driving accidents Sleep apnea is a chronic condition that requires long-term management. Lifestyle changes, mouthpieces, surgery, and breathing devices can successfully treat sleep apnea in many people.",

Otherwise, there are few, well-conducted clinical trials.

Some people with central sleep apnea may benefit from CPAP. People with central apnea of the Cheyne-Stokes type have fewer episodes of apnea and a lower severity of heart failure with this treatment but do not survive longer. Acetazolamide can help people who have central sleep apnea caused by high altitude and possibly even people at sea level.

This is a medical doctor who specializes in eye diseases and eye surgery.Adults are usually awake for the procedure. Numbing medicine (local anesthesia) is given using eyedrops or a shot. This blocks pain. You will also get medicine to help you relax. Children usually receive general anesthesia. This is medicine that puts them into a deep sleep so that they are unable to feel pain.The doctor uses a special microscope to view the eye. A small cut (incision) is made in the eye.The lens is removed in one of the following ways, depending on the type of cataract: Phacoemulsification: With this procedure, the doctor uses a tool that produces sound waves to break up the cataract into small pieces. The pieces are then suctioned out. This procedure uses a very small incision. Extracapsular extraction: The doctor uses a small tool to remove the cataract in mostly one piece. This procedure uses a larger incision. Laser surgery: The doctor guides a machine that uses laser energy to make the incisions and soften the cataract. The rest of the surgery is much like phacoemulsification. Using the laser instead of a knife (scalpel) may speed recovery and be more accurate. After the cataract is removed, a manmade lens, called an intraocular lens (IOL), is usually placed into the eye to restore the focusing power of the old lens (cataract). It helps improve your vision.The doctor may close the incision with very small stitches. Usually, a self-sealing (sutureless) method is used. If you have stitches, they may need to be removed later.The surgery lasts less than half an hour. Most times, just one eye is done. If you have cataracts in both eyes, your doctor may suggest waiting at least 1 to 2 weeks between each surgery.",

The major features of this disorder include a characteristic facial appearance, delayed growth and development, intellectual disability, and seizures. Almost everyone with this disorder has distinctive facial features, including a broad, flat nasal bridge and a high forehead. This combination is described as a \"Greek warrior helmet\" appearance. The eyes are widely spaced and may be protruding. Other characteristic facial features include a shortened distance between the nose and upper lip (a short philtrum), a downturned mouth, a small chin (micrognathia), and poorly formed ears with small holes (pits) or flaps of skin (tags). Additionally, affected individuals may have asymmetrical facial features and an unusually small head (microcephaly). People with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome experience delayed growth and development. Slow growth begins before birth, and affected infants tend to have problems feeding and gaining weight (failure to thrive). They also have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and underdeveloped muscles. Motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking are significantly delayed. Most children and adults with this disorder also have short stature. Intellectual disability ranges from mild to severe in people with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. Compared to people with other forms of intellectual disability, their socialization skills are strong, while verbal communication and language skills tend to be weaker. Most affected children also have seizures, which may be resistant to treatment. Seizures tend to disappear with age. Additional features of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome include skin changes such as mottled or dry skin, skeletal abnormalities such as abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis and kyphosis), dental problems including missing teeth, and an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) and/or in the lip (cleft lip). Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome can also cause abnormalities of the eyes, heart, genitourinary tract, and brain. A condition called Pitt-Rogers-Danks syndrome has features that overlap with those of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. Researchers now recognize that these two conditions are actually part of a single syndrome with variable signs and symptoms.",

Some ads for dietary supplements in magazines, online, or on TV seem to promise that these supplements will make you feel better, keep you from getting sick, or even help you live longer. Often, there is little, if any, good scientific research supporting these claims. Supplements may cost a lot, could be harmful, or simply might not be helpful. Talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian for advice.",

                "article": "What is shingles? Shingles is a painful skin rash, often with blisters. It is also called Herpes Zoster, or just Zoster. A shingles rash usually appears on one side of the face or body and lasts from 2 to 4 weeks. Its main symptom is pain, which can be quite severe. Other symptoms of shingles can include fever, headache, chills and upset stomach. Very rarely, a shingles infection can lead to pneumonia, hearing problems, blindness, brain inflammation (encephalitits) or death. For about 1 person in 5, severe pain can continue even long after the rash clears up. This is called post-herpetic neuralgia. Shingles is caused by the Varicella Zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. Only someone who has had chickenpox -- or, rarely, has gotten chickenpox vaccine -- can get shingles. The virus stays in your body, and can cause shingles many years later. You can't catch shingles from another person with shingles. However, a person who has never had chickenpox (or chickenpox vaccine) could get chickenpox from someone with shingles. This is not very common. Shingles is far more common in people 50 years of age and older than in younger people. It is also more common in people whose immune systems are weakened because of a disease such as cancer, or drugs such as steroids or chemotherapy. At least 1 million people a year in the United States get shingles. Shingles vaccine A vaccine for shingles was licensed in 2 . In clinical trials, the vaccine reduced the risk of shingles by 50%. It can also reduce pain in people who still get shingles after being vaccinated. A single dose of shingles vaccine is recommended for adults 60 years of age and older. Some people should not get shingles vaccine or should wait. A person should not get shingles vaccine who. Has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of shingles vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies. Has a weakened immune system because of current. AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system. Treatment with drugs that affect the immune system, such as prolonged use of high-dose steroids. Cancer treatment such as radiation or chemotherapy. Cancer affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system, such as leukemia or lymphoma. Is pregnant, or might be pregnant. Women should not become pregnant until at least 4 weeks after getting shingles vaccine. Someone with a minor acute illness, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. But anyone with a moderate or severe acute illness should usually wait until they recover before getting the vaccine. This includes anyone with a temperature of 1 .3F or higher. What are the risks from shingles vaccine? A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. However, the risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. No serious problems have been identified with shingles vaccine. Mild problems. Redness, soreness, swelling, or itching at the site of the injection (about 1 person in 3). Headache (about 1 person in 70). Like all vaccines, shingles vaccine is being closely monitored for unusual or severe problems. What if there is a serious reaction? What should I look for?. Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. What should I do?. If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor. Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the VAERS website or by calling 1-8 -822-7967. VAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice. How can I learn more?. Ask your doctor. Contact your local or state health department. Contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Call 1-8 -232-4636 (1-8 -CDC-INFO).

                "article": "Chronic granulomatous disease is a disorder that causes the immune system to malfunction, resulting in a form of immunodeficiency. Immunodeficiencies are conditions in which the immune system is not able to protect the body from foreign invaders such as bacteria and fungi. Individuals with chronic granulomatous disease may have recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. People with this condition may also have areas of inflammation (granulomas) in various tissues that can result in damage to those tissues. The features of chronic granulomatous disease usually first appear in childhood, although some individuals do not show symptoms until later in life. People with chronic granulomatous disease typically have at least one serious bacterial or fungal infection every 3 to 4 years. The lungs are the most frequent area of infection; pneumonia is a common feature of this condition. Individuals with chronic granulomatous disease may develop a type of fungal pneumonia, called mulch pneumonitis, which causes fever and shortness of breath after exposure to decaying organic materials such as mulch, hay, or dead leaves. Exposure to these organic materials and the numerous fungi involved in their decomposition causes people with chronic granulomatous disease to develop fungal infections in their lungs. Other common areas of infection in people with chronic granulomatous disease include the skin, liver, and lymph nodes. Inflammation can occur in many different areas of the body in people with chronic granulomatous disease. Most commonly, granulomas occur in the gastrointestinal tract and the genitourinary tract. In many cases the intestinal wall is inflamed, causing a form of inflammatory bowel disease that varies in severity but can lead to stomach pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, nausea, and vomiting. Other common areas of inflammation in people with chronic granulomatous disease include the stomach, colon, and rectum, as well as the mouth, throat, and skin. Additionally, granulomas within the gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue breakdown and pus production (abscesses). Inflammation in the stomach can prevent food from passing through to the intestines (gastric outlet obstruction), leading to an inability to digest food. These digestive problems cause vomiting after eating and weight loss. In the genitourinary tract, inflammation can occur in the kidneys and bladder. Inflammation of the lymph nodes (lymphadenitis) and bone marrow (osteomyelitis), which both produce immune cells, can lead to further impairment of the immune system. Rarely, people with chronic granulomatous disease develop autoimmune disorders, which occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. Repeated episodes of infection and inflammation reduce the life expectancy of individuals with chronic granulomatous disease; however, with treatment, most affected individuals live into mid- to late adulthood.",

                "article": "Pharmacodynamics Ritalin is a mild central nervous system stimulant. The mode of action in man is not completely understood, but Ritalin presumably activates the brain stem arousal system and cortex to produce its stimulant effect. There is neither specific evidence which clearly establishes the mechanism whereby Ritalin produces its mental and behavioral effects in children, nor conclusive evidence regarding how these effects relate to the condition of the central nervous system. Effects on QT Interval The effect of Focalin   XR (dexmethylphenidate, the pharmacologically active d-enantiomer of Ritalin) on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo- and open label active (moxifloxacin)-controlled study following single doses of Focalin   XR 4  in 75 healthy volunteers. ECGs were collected up to 12 h post-dose. Frederica   s method for heart rate correction was employed to derive the corrected QT interval (QTcF). The maximum mean prolongation of QTcF intervals was &lt;5 ms, and the upper limit of the 90% confidence interval was below 10 ms for all time matched comparisons versus placebo. This was below the threshold of clinical concern and there was no evident-exposure response relationship. Pharmacokinetics Ritalin in the SR tablets is more slowly but as extensively absorbed as in the regular tablets. Relative bioavailability of the SR tablet compared to the Ritalin tablet, measured by the urinary excretion of Ritalin major metabolite (?-phenyl-2-piperidine acetic acid) was 1 % (49%-168%) in children and 1 % (85%-152%) in adults. The time to peak rate in children was 4.7 hours (1.3-8.2 hours) for the SR tablets and 1.9 hours (0.3-4.4 hours) for the tablets. An average of 67% of SR tablet dose was excreted in children as compared to 86% in adults. In a clinical study involving adult subjects who received SR tablets, plasma concentrations of Ritalin   s major metabolite appeared to be greater in females than in males. No gender differences were observed for Ritalin plasma concentration in the same subjects.",

The pattern of body parts affected by numbness often indicates which part of the nerve pathway is malfunctioning: Part of a limb: Peripheral nerve or sometimes spinal nerve root malfunction Arm and leg on the same side of the body: Brain malfunction Both sides of the body below a specific level of the body: Spinal cord malfunction, as occurs in transverse myelitis (which causes inflammation across the entire width of the spinal cord) Both sides, mainly in the hands and feet: Simultaneous malfunction of many peripheral nerves throughout the body (a polyneuropathy) Then doctors ask about the person's other symptoms and medical history. Doctors also do a physical examination. What they find during the history and physical examination often suggests a cause and the tests that may need to be done (see table Some Causes and Features of Numbness).Doctors ask the person to describe the numbness. Then doctors may ask specific questions: When numbness began How quickly it began Whether the person also has other symptoms such as abnormal sensations, weakness or paralysis, loss of bowel or bladder control, retention of urine, vision problems, difficulty swallowing, or deterioration of mental function Whether any event, such as pressure on a limb, an injury, sleeping in an awkward position, or an infection, triggered the symptoms Knowing how quickly numbness and other symptoms began helps doctors determine the type of disorder.The person is asked about symptoms that may suggest a cause. For example, back and/or neck pain suggests osteoarthritis, a ruptured disk, or another disorder that puts pressure on the spinal cord.Doctors also ask whether the person has had a disorder that can cause numbness, particularly diabetes, chronic kidney disease, infections (such as HIV infection or Lyme disease), a stroke, or arthritis. Doctors may ask whether any family members have had similar symptoms or have a hereditary disorder that affects the nervous system. They ask the person about use of drugs, including recreational drugs, and about possible exposure to toxins.The physical examination includes a complete evaluation of the nervous system (neurologic examination), focusing on testing sensation (whether the person can feel stimuli, such as touch and temperature, normally), as well as reflexes and muscle function.TableSome Causes and Features of Numbness Cause Common Features* Tests Numbness in both limbs (arm and leg) on one side of the body Disorders that affect the outer layer of the cerebrum (the largest area of the brain), such as Stroke Tumors Multiple sclerosis Degenerative brain disorders Loss of sensation on the same side of the face and body that is affected by the disorder and loss of the ability to recognize items by touch Usually weakness, loss of coordination, and other symptoms indicating malfunction of the nervous system MRI or CT of the brain Disorders that affect the upper part of the brain stem, such as Stroke Tumors Abscesses (pockets of pus) Loss of sensation on the same side of the face and body that is affected by the disorder Often double vision MRI or CT of the brain Disorders that affect the lower part of the brain stem, such as Stroke Tumors Degenerative brain disorders Loss of sensation on one side of the face and on the opposite side of the body affected by the disorder Often vision problems and difficulty chewing, swallowing, and speaking MRI of the brain Numbness in the limbs or torso on both sides Disorders that affect the width of the spinal cord, such as Compression of the spinal cord by injuries, tumors, a ruptured or herniated disk, hematomas (pockets of blood), or abscesses (pockets of pus) Acute transverse myelitis (sudden inflammation of the spinal cord) Loss of sensation and usually weakness below a certain level of the body No loss of sensation in the face Usually retention of urine, loss of bowel and bladder control (incontinence), and/or reduced sexual response, including erectile dysfunction in men MRI of the spinal cord Cauda equina syndrome, caused by pressure, as may result from A ruptured or herniated disk Spread of cancer to the spine Numbness mainly in the thighs, buttocks, bladder, genitals, and the area between them (saddle area) Usually pain in the lower back Often retention of urine, loss of bowel and bladder control, and/or reduced sexual response, including erectile dysfunction in men MRI of the spinal cord Polyneuropathies (simultaneous malfunction of many peripheral nerves throughout the body), as may result from Use of certain drugs Diabetes Chronic kidney disease Metabolic disorders, such as uremia (build up of toxic substances in blood due to kidney failure), and vitamin B12 deficiency Infections, such as HIV infection or Lyme disease Numbness and abnormal sensations in about the same areas on both sides of the body, mainly in the feet and hands Sometimes weakness and loss of reflexes Nerve conduction studies (measuring how fast nerves transmit signals) and electromyography (stimulating muscles and recording their electrical activity) Other tests depending on the disorder suspected Demyelinating disorders (disorders that cause nerves to become inflamed and lose their outer layer, called the myelin sheath), such as Multiple sclerosis Often weakness or clumsiness and abnormal sensations (such as tingling or numbness) Sometimes changes in vision or speech MRI of the brain and spinal cord Spinal tap (lumbar puncture) to examine a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord) Numbness in part of one limb Disorders that affect a spinal nerve root such as A ruptured or herniated disk Collapse of the backbones (vertebrae) due to arthritis or osteoporosis Pain that Sometimes shoots down an arm or a leg May feel like an electric shock May be worsened by moving the spine, coughing, or doing a Valsalva maneuver (forcefully trying to exhale without letting air escape through the nose or mouth) Often weakness and/or reduced or absent reflexes in the area supplied by the nerve root A doctor's examination Sometimes MRI or CT of the spinal cord Sometimes nerve conduction studies and electromyography Disorders that affect a plexus (a network of nerve fibers), such as Thoracic outlet compression syndrome An injury such as a stabbing Cancer that spreads to organs near a plexus Brachial neuritis (sudden malfunction of the plexus in the neck and shoulder) Numbness, pain, and/or weakness in a relatively large area of a limb Nerve conduction studies and electromyography MRI Mononeuropathy (malfunction of one peripheral nerve), as occurs in Carpal tunnel syndrome Peroneal nerve palsy (affecting a nerve near the knee) Numbness with or without pain Often weakness and reduced or absent reflexes in an area supplied by one nerve A doctor's examination Sometimes nerve conduction studies and electromyography *Features include symptoms and results of the doctor's examination.

Other drugs tighten muscles and can lessen leakage. Some women find that using an estrogen vaginal cream may help relieve stress or urge incontinence. A low dose of estrogen cream is applied directly to the vaginal walls and urethral tissue. A doctor may inject a substance that thickens the area around the urethra to help close the bladder opening. This can reduce stress incontinence in women. This treatment may need to be repeated. Some women may be able to use a medical device, such as a urethral insert, a small disposable device inserted into the urethra. A pessary, a stiff ring inserted into the vagina, may help prevent leaking if you have a prolapsed bladder or vagina. Nerve stimulation, which sends mild electric current to the nerves around the bladder that help control urination, may be another option. Surgery can sometimes improve or cure incontinence if it's caused by a change in the position of the bladder or blockage due to an enlarged prostate.Even after treatment, some people still leak urine from time to time.

                "article": "Summary : Puberty is when your body changes and you develop from being a girl to a woman. Learn what changes to expect so that you feel more prepared. Expect Changes with Puberty : Know that you are going through a growth spurt. You have not grown this much since you were a baby. You might grow 2 to 4 inches in a year. When you are done going through puberty, you will be almost as tall as you will be when you are a grown up. Your feet may be the first to grow. They seem really big at first, but you will grow into them. Expect to gain weight. This is normal and needed to have healthy menstrual cycles. You will notice that you get curvier, with bigger hips and breasts than when you were a little girl. Expect Lots of Body Changes : Your body makes hormones to get puberty started. Here are some changes you will start seeing. You will. Sweat more. You may notice that your armpits smell now. Shower every day and use deodorant. Start developing breasts. They start as small breast buds under your nipples. Eventually your breasts grow more, and you may want to start wearing a bra. Ask your mom or a trusted adult to take you shopping for a bra. Grow body hair. You will start getting pubic hair. This is hair on and around your private parts (genitals). It starts out light and thin and gets thicker and darker as you get older. You will also grow hair in your armpits. Get your period. See \"menstrual periods\" below. Get some pimples or acne. This is caused by the hormones that start in puberty. Keep your face clean and use non-oily face cream or sunscreen. Talk to your health care provider if you are having a lot of problems with pimples. Know When Puberty Happens : Most girls go through puberty somewhere between being 8 to 15 years old. There is a wide age range when puberty starts. That is why some kids in 7th grade still look like young children and others look really grown up. You may wonder when you will get your period. Usually girls get their period about 2 years after their breasts start to grow. Menstrual Periods : Each month, one of your ovaries releases an egg. The egg goes through the fallopian tube into the uterus. Each month, the uterus creates a lining of blood and tissue. If the egg is fertilized by a sperm (this is what could happen with unprotected sex), the egg may plant itself into this uterus lining and result in a pregnancy. If the egg is not fertilized, it just passes through the uterus. The uterus no longer needs the extra blood and tissue. The blood passes through the vagina as your period. The period usually lasts 2 to 7 days and happens about once a month. Be prepared to get your period. Talk to your provider about when you might start getting your period. Your provider may be able to tell you, from other changes in your body, when you should expect your period. Keep supplies for your period in your backpack or purse. You will want some pads or pantiliners. Being prepared for when you get your period keeps you from being too worried. Ask your mother, an older female relative, friend, or someone you trust to help you get supplies. Pads come in all different sizes. They have a sticky side so you can stick them on your underwear. Pantiliners are small, thin pads. Once you have your period, you may want to learn how to use tampons. You insert a tampon into your vagina to absorb the blood. The tampon has a string that you use to pull it out. Have your mother or a trusted female friend teach you how to use tampons. Change tampons every 4 to 8 hours. Be Aware of Mood Swings : You can feel really moody right before you get your period. This is caused by hormones. You might feel. Irritable. Have trouble sleeping. Sad. Less confident about yourself. You may even have trouble figuring out what you want to wear to school. Luckily, feeling moody should go away once you start your period. Accept Changes in Your Body : Try to be comfortable with your body changing. If you are stressed about changes, talk to your parents or a provider that you trust. Avoid dieting to prevent normal weight gain during puberty. Dieting is really unhealthy when you are growing. When to Call the Doctor : Talk to your health care provider if you have. Worries about puberty. Really long, heavy periods. Irregular periods that do not seem to get regular. Lots of pain and cramping with your periods. Any itching or odor from your private parts. This could be a sign of a yeast infection or a sexually transmitted disease. A lot of acne. You may be able to use special soap or medicine to help.",

This type of therapy also involves exercise and training. Its goal is to help the stroke patient relearn everyday activities such as eating, drinking and swallowing, dressing, bathing, cooking, reading and writing, and using the toilet. Occupational therapists seek to help the patient become independent or semi-independent.Speech therapy helps stroke patients relearn language and speaking skills, or learn other forms of communication. Speech therapy is appropriate for patients who have no problems with cognition or thinking, but have problems understanding speech or written words, or problems forming speech.

                "article": "What is shingles? Shingles is a painful skin rash, often with blisters. It is also called Herpes Zoster, or just Zoster. A shingles rash usually appears on one side of the face or body and lasts from 2 to 4 weeks. Its main symptom is pain, which can be quite severe. Other symptoms of shingles can include fever, headache, chills and upset stomach. Very rarely, a shingles infection can lead to pneumonia, hearing problems, blindness, brain inflammation (encephalitits) or death. For about 1 person in 5, severe pain can continue even long after the rash clears up. This is called post-herpetic neuralgia. Shingles is caused by the Varicella Zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. Only someone who has had chickenpox -- or, rarely, has gotten chickenpox vaccine -- can get shingles. The virus stays in your body, and can cause shingles many years later. You can't catch shingles from another person with shingles. However, a person who has never had chickenpox (or chickenpox vaccine) could get chickenpox from someone with shingles. This is not very common. Shingles is far more common in people 50 years of age and older than in younger people. It is also more common in people whose immune systems are weakened because of a disease such as cancer, or drugs such as steroids or chemotherapy. At least 1 million people a year in the United States get shingles. Shingles vaccine A vaccine for shingles was licensed in 2 . In clinical trials, the vaccine reduced the risk of shingles by 50%. It can also reduce pain in people who still get shingles after being vaccinated. A single dose of shingles vaccine is recommended for adults 60 years of age and older. Some people should not get shingles vaccine or should wait. A person should not get shingles vaccine who. Has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of shingles vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies. Has a weakened immune system because of current. AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system. Treatment with drugs that affect the immune system, such as prolonged use of high-dose steroids. Cancer treatment such as radiation or chemotherapy. Cancer affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system, such as leukemia or lymphoma. Is pregnant, or might be pregnant. Women should not become pregnant until at least 4 weeks after getting shingles vaccine. Someone with a minor acute illness, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. But anyone with a moderate or severe acute illness should usually wait until they recover before getting the vaccine. This includes anyone with a temperature of 1 .3F or higher. What are the risks from shingles vaccine? A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. However, the risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. No serious problems have been identified with shingles vaccine. Mild problems. Redness, soreness, swelling, or itching at the site of the injection (about 1 person in 3). Headache (about 1 person in 70). Like all vaccines, shingles vaccine is being closely monitored for unusual or severe problems. What if there is a serious reaction? What should I look for?. Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. What should I do?. If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor. Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the VAERS website or by calling 1-8 -822-7967. VAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice. How can I learn more?. Ask your doctor. Contact your local or state health department. Contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Call 1-8 -232-4636 (1-8 -CDC-INFO).

The PNS nerves connect your brain and spinal cord with the rest of your body. Damage to these nerves makes it hard for them to transmit signals. As a result, your muscles have trouble responding to your brain. No one knows what causes the syndrome. Sometimes it is triggered by an infection, surgery, or a vaccination. The first symptom is usually weakness or a tingling feeling in your legs. The feeling can spread to your upper body. In severe cases, you become almost paralyzed. This is life-threatening. You might need a respirator to breathe. Symptoms usually worsen over a period of weeks and then stabilize. Guillain-Barre can be hard to diagnose. Possible tests include nerve tests and a spinal tap. Most people recover. Recovery can take a few weeks to a few years. Treatment can help symptoms, and may include medicines or a procedure called plasma exchange.

                "article": "Guillain-Barr syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that affects the nerves. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. In Guillain-Barr syndrome, the immune response damages peripheral nerves, which are the nerves that connect the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) to the limbs and organs. Specifically, the immune response affects a particular part of peripheral nerves called axons, which are the extensions of nerve cells (neurons) that transmit nerve impulses. Guillain-Barr syndrome can affect the neurons that control muscle movement (motor neurons); the neurons that transmit sensory signals such as pain, temperature, and touch (sensory neurons); or both. As a result, affected individuals can experience muscle weakness or lose the ability to feel certain sensations.Muscle weakness or paralysis are the characteristic features of Guillain-Barr syndrome. The weakness often begins in the legs and spreads to the arms, torso, and face and is commonly accompanied by numbness, tingling, or pain. Additional signs and symptoms of the condition include difficulty swallowing and difficulty breathing. Occasionally, the nerves that control involuntary functions of the body such as blood pressure and heart rate are affected, which can lead to fluctuating blood pressure or an abnormal heartbeat (cardiac arrhythmia).There are several types of Guillain-Barr syndrome, classified by the part of the peripheral nerve involved in the condition. The most common type of Guillain-Barr syndrome is acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP). In AIDP, the immune response damages myelin, which is the covering that protects axons and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. In two other types of Guillain-Barr syndrome, acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) and acute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN), the axons themselves are damaged by the immune response. In AMAN, only the axons of motor neurons are damaged. In AMSAN, the axons of sensory neurons are also damaged. Because of sensory nerve damage, affected individuals can lose the ability to sense the position of their limbs and can have abnormal or absent reflexes (areflexia).Miller Fisher syndrome, another type of Guillain-Barr syndrome, involves cranial nerves, which extend from the brain to various areas of the head and neck. Miller Fisher syndrome is characterized by three features: weakness or paralysis of the muscles that move the eyes (ophthalmoplegia), problems with balance and coordination (ataxia), and areflexia. People with this condition can have other signs and symptoms common in Guillain-Barr syndrome, such as muscle weakness.Guillain-Barr syndrome occurs in people of all ages. The development of the condition usually follows a pattern. Prior to developing the condition, most people with Guillain-Barr syndrome have a bacterial or viral infection. The first phase of Guillain-Barr syndrome, during which signs and symptoms of the condition worsen, can last up to four weeks, although the peak of the illness is usually reached in one to two weeks. During the second phase, called the plateau, signs and symptoms of Guillain-Barr syndrome stabilize. This phase can last weeks or months. During the recovery phase, symptoms improve. However, some people with Guillain-Barr syndrome never fully recover and can still experience excessive tiredness (fatigue), muscle weakness, or muscle pain.",

                "article": " Summary   What is a tremor?  A tremor is a rhythmic shaking movement in one or more parts of your body. It is involuntary, meaning that you cannot control it. This shaking happens because of muscle contractions. A tremor is most often in your hands, but it could also affect your arms, head, vocal cords, trunk, and legs. It may come and go, or it may be constant. Tremor can happen on its own or be caused by another disorder.  What are the types of tremor?  There are several types of tremor, including Essential tremor, sometimes called benign essential tremor. This is the most common type. It usually affects your hands, but it can also affect your head, voice, tongue, legs, and trunk. Parkinsonian tremor, which is a common symptom in people who have Parkinson's disease. It is usually affects one or both hands when they are at rest, but it can affect the chin, lips, face, and legs. Dystonic tremor, which happens in people who have dystonia. Dystonia is a movement disorder in which you have involuntary muscle contractions. The contractions cause you to have twisting and repetitive movements. It can affect any muscle in the body.  What causes tremor?  Generally, tremor is caused by a problem in the deep parts of the brain that control movements. For most types, the cause is unknown. Some types are inherited and run in families. There can also be other causes, such as Neurologic disorders, including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and traumatic brain injury Certain medicines, such as asthma medicines, amphetamines, caffeine, corticosteroids, and medicines used for certain psychiatric and neurological disorders Alcohol use disorder or alcohol withdrawal Mercury poisoning Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) Liver or kidney failure Anxiety or panic  Who is at risk for tremor?  Anyone can get tremor, but it is most common in middle-aged and older adults. For certain types, having a family history raises your risk of getting it.  What are the symptoms of tremor?  Symptoms of tremor may include Rhythmic shaking in the hands, arms, head, legs, or torso Shaky voice Difficulty writing or drawing Problems holding and controlling utensils, such as a spoon  How is tremor diagnosed?  To make a diagnosis, your health care provider Will take your medical history Will do a physical exam, which includes checking Whether the tremor happens when the muscles are at rest or in action The location of the tremor How often you have the tremor and how strong it is Will do a neurological exam, including checking for Problems with balance Problems with speech Increased muscle stiffness May do blood or urine tests to look for the cause May do imaging tests to help figure out if the cause is damage in your brain May do tests which check your abilities to do daily tasks such as handwriting and holding a fork or cup May do an electromyogram. This is a test which measures involuntary muscle activity and how your muscles respond to nerve stimulation  What are the treatments for tremor?  There is no cure for most forms of tremor, but there are treatments to help manage symptoms. In some cases, the symptoms may be so mild that you do not need treatment. Finding the right treatment depends on getting the right diagnosis of the cause. Tremor caused by another medical condition may get better or go away when you treat that condition. If your tremor is caused by a certain medicine, stopping that medicine usually makes the tremor go away. Treatments for tremor where the cause is not found include Medicines. There are different medicines for the specific types of tremor. Another option is Botox injections, which can treat several different types. Surgery may be used for severe cases that do not get better with medicines. The most common type is deep brain stimulation (DBS). Physical, speech-language, and occupational therapy, which may help to control tremor and deal with the daily challenges caused by the tremor If you find that caffeine and other stimulants trigger your tremors, it may be helpful to cut them from your diet.

But if you have too much in your blood, it can stick to the walls of your arteries and narrow or even block them. This puts you at risk for coronary artery disease and other heart diseases. Cholesterol travels through the blood on proteins called lipoproteins. One type, LDL, is sometimes called the \"bad\" cholesterol. A high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. Another type, HDL, is sometimes called the \"good\" cholesterol. It carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Then your liver removes the cholesterol from your body.  What are the treatments for high cholesterol?  If you have high cholesterol, lifestyle changes can help you to lower your cholesterol level. But sometimes the lifestyle changes are not enough, and you need to take cholesterol medicines. You should still continue with the lifestyle changes even though you are taking medicines.  Who needs cholesterol medicines?  Your health care provider may prescribe medicine if: You have already had a heart attack or stroke, or you have peripheral arterial disease Your LDL (bad) cholesterol level is 190 mg/dL or higher You are 40-75 years old, you have diabetes, and your LDL cholesterol level is 70 mg/dL or higher You are 40-75 years old, you have a high risk of developing heart disease or stroke, and your LDL cholesterol level is 70 mg/dL or higher  What are the different types of medicines for cholesterol?  There are several types of cholesterol-lowering drugs available, including Statins, which block the liver from making cholesterol Bile acid sequestrants, which decrease the amount of fat absorbed from food Cholesterol absorption inhibitors, which decrease the amount of cholesterol absorbed from food and lower triglycerides. Nicotinic acid (niacin), which lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglycerides and raises HDL (good) cholesterol. Even though you can buy niacin without a prescription, you should talk to your health care provider before taking it to lower your cholesterol. High doses of niacin can cause serious side effects. PCSK9 inhibitors, which block a protein called PCSK9. This helps your liver remove and clear LDL cholesterol from your blood. Fibrates, which lower triglycerides. They may also raise HDL (good) cholesterol. If you take them with statins, they may increase the risk of muscle problems. Combination medicines, which include more than one type of cholesterol-lowering medicine There are also a few other cholesterol medicines (lomitapide and mipomersen) that are only for people who have familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).

                "article": "The most common causes of memory loss are Age-related changes in memory (most common) Mild cognitive impairment Dementia Depression  Age-related changes in memory  (called age-associated memory impairment) refer to the normal slight decline in brain function that occurs as people age. Most older people have some memory problems. Retrieving memories of new things, such as what is a new neighbor's name or how to use a new computer program, takes longer. Older people also have to rehearse new memories more often for the memories to be stored. People with this type of memory loss occasionally forget things, such as where they left their car keys. But for them, unlike people with dementia, the ability to do daily activities or to think is not impaired. Given enough time, these people usually remember, although sometimes later than is convenient. This type of memory loss is not a sign of dementia or early Alzheimer disease. Mild cognitive impairment  is an imprecise term used to describe impairments in mental function that are more severe than normal age-related changes but less severe than those caused by dementia. Memory loss is often the most obvious symptom. People with mild cognitive impairment have trouble remembering recent conversations and may forget important appointments or social events, but they typically remember past events. Attention and the ability to do daily activities are not affected. However, up to half of people with mild cognitive impairment develop dementia within 3 years. Dementia  is a much more serious decline in mental function. Memory loss, particularly for recently acquired information, is often the first symptom, and it becomes worse with time. People who have dementia may forget entire events, not just the details. They may do the following: Have difficulty remembering how to do things they have done many times before and how to get to places they have often been to No longer do things that require many steps, such as following a recipe Forget to pay bills or keep appointments Forget to turn off a stove, lock the house when they leave, or take care of a child left in their care Unlike people with age-related changes in memory, people with dementia are unaware of their memory loss and often deny that they have such loss.Finding the right word, naming objects, understanding language, and doing, planning, and organizing daily activities become more and more difficult. People with dementia eventually become disoriented, not knowing what time or even what year it is or where they are. Their personality may change. They may become more irritable, anxious, paranoid, inflexible, or disruptive.There are many forms of dementia. Alzheimer disease is the most common. Most forms of dementia progressively worsen until the person's death.Some conditions that increase the risk of heart and blood vessel disorders (such as high blood pressure, high levels of cholesterol, and diabetes) seem to increase the risk of dementia. Depression  can cause a type of memory loss (called pseudodementia) that resembles memory loss due to dementia. Also, dementia commonly causes depression. Thus, determining whether dementia or depression is the cause of memory loss can be difficult. However, people with memory loss due to depression, unlike those with dementia, are aware of their memory loss and complain about it. Also, they rarely forget important current events or personal matters and usually have other symptoms, such as intense sadness, sleeping problems (too little or too much), sluggishness, or loss of appetite. Stress  can interfere with forming a memory and with recalling a memory, partly by preoccupying people and thus preventing them from paying attention to other things. However, in certain circumstances, particularly when stress is mild to moderate and does not last long, it can enhance memory.",

Having a family member present is helpful because people with memory difficulties may not be able to describe their symptoms accurately. What doctors find during the history and physical examination often suggests a cause and the tests that may need to be done (see table Some Causes and Features of Memory Loss).Doctors often talk to the person and the persons family members separately because family members may not feel free to describe the symptoms candidly with the person listening.Doctors ask specific questions about the memory loss: What types of things the person forgets (for example, whether the person forgets words or names or gets lost) When the memory problems started Whether memory loss is getting worse How the memory loss is affecting the persons ability to function at work and at home Doctors also ask whether the person has other symptoms, such as difficulty using or understanding language and changes in their eating and sleeping habits or mood. They ask about all disorders the person has had and all the drugs the person is taking (including recreational or illegal drugs, over-the counter drugs, and nutritional supplements) to check for possible causes. Information about the persons education, jobs, and social activities can help doctors better assess the person's previous mental function and gauge the severity of the problem. Doctors ask whether any family members have had dementia or early mild cognitive impairment.During the physical examination, doctors evaluate all body systems but focus on the nervous system (neurologic examination), including evaluation of mental function (mental status testing).In mental status testing, doctors ask people to answer questions or do specific tasks to evaluate various aspects of mental function, such as Orientation to time, place, and person: State the current date and place and who they are. Attention: Repeat a short list of words. Concentration: Spell \"world\" backwards or repeat their phone number forward, then backward. Short-term memory: Recall the short list of words after several minutes. Long-term memory: Answer questions about the distant past. Use of language: Name common objects and body parts, and read, write, and repeat certain phrases. Ability to understand spatial relationships: Copy simple and complex structures (for example, using building blocks) and draw an object such as clock, cube, or house. This testing also assesses abstract thinking, comprehension, the ability to follow commands and solve math problems, awareness of the illness, and mood.TableSome Causes and Features of Memory Loss Cause Common Features* Tests Age-related memory changes (age-associated memory impairment) Occasional forgetfulness of such things as names or the location of car keys No effect on thinking, other mental functions, or the ability to do daily activities A doctor's examination (particularly a neurologic examination and mental status testing to assess functions such as attention, orientation, and memory) Mild cognitive impairment Memory loss that is more severe than expected for a person's age, particularly difficulty remembering recent events and conversations (short-term memory loss) No effect on the ability to do daily activities An increased risk of developing dementia A doctor's examination Sometimes formal neuropsychologic testing, which resembles mental status testing but evaluates function in more detail Dementia Memory loss that becomes worse as time passes, eventually with no awareness of the loss Difficulty using and understanding language, doing usual manual tasks, thinking, and planning (for example, planning and shopping for meals), resulting in not being able to function normally Disorientation (for example, not knowing the time or location) Difficulty recognizing faces or common objects Changes in personality or behavior (for example, becoming irritable, agitated, paranoid, inflexible, or disruptive) A doctors examination Usually MRI or CT of the brain Sometimes formal neuropsychologic testing Possibly a spinal tap (lumbar puncture) to measure levels of two abnormal proteins (amyloid and tau) that occur in Alzheimer disease Sometimes blood tests to check for certain causes, such as an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) or a vitamin deficiency Depression Memory loss and awareness of the loss, usually accompanied by intense sadness, and lack of interest in usual pleasures Sometimes sleep problems (too little or too much), loss of appetite, and slowing of thinking, speech, and general activity Common among people with dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or age-related changes in memory A doctors examination Sometimes use of standardized questionnaires to identify depression Drugs, such as Drugs with anticholinergic effects, including some antidepressants and many antihistamines (used in OTC sleep aids, cold remedies, and allergy drugs) Opioids Drugs that help people sleep (sedatives) Use of a drug that can cause memory loss Often recent use of a new drug, an increase in a drugs dose, or a change in health that prevents the drug from being processed and eliminated from the body normally, as can occur in kidney or liver disorders Typically stopping the drug to see whether memory improves *Features include symptoms and results of the doctor's examination.

                "article": "Memory loss and fear of dementia are common sources of worry among older people. Usually, memory loss results from normal age-related changes in the brain, which slow mental functions slightly but do not significantly impair them. Memory loss due to dementia usually interferes with the ability to do daily activities and becomes progressively worse. People who are aware of memory loss may not have dementia. Doctors can usually identify the cause based on results of the examination, imaging tests (such as MRI or CT), and other tests, including formal tests of mental function. Having a healthy lifestyle, staying mentally active, and participating in social activities may help maintain mental function or postpone its decline. Using lists and other memory aids, focusing on one thing at a time, and getting organized can help older people compensate for age-related changes in memory. Drugs called cholinesterase inhibitors (such as donepezil) may help with memory, particularly if people have Alzheimer disease or Lewy body dementia, and donepezil may help people with mild cognitive impairment.",

                "article": "The best way to treat a cough is to treat its cause. However, sometimes the cause is unknown. Other treatments, such as medicines and a vaporizer, can help relieve the cough itself. Treating the Cause of a Cough Acute and Subacute Cough An acute cough lasts less than 3 weeks. Common causes of an acute cough are a common cold or other upper respiratory infections. Examples of other upper respiratory infections include the flu, pneumonia, and whooping cough. An acute cough usually goes away after the illness that caused it is over. A subacute cough lasts 3 to 8 weeks. This type of cough remains even after a cold or other respiratory infection is over. Studies show that antibiotics and cold medicines can't cure a cold. However, your doctor may prescribe medicines to treat another cause of an acute or subacute cough. For example, antibiotics may be given for pneumonia. Chronic Cough A chronic cough lasts more than 8 weeks. Common causes of a chronic cough are upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). \"UACS\" is a term used to describe conditions that inflame the upper airways and cause a cough. Examples include sinus infections and allergies. These conditions can cause mucus (a slimy substance) to run down your throat from the back of your nose. This is called postnasal drip. If you have a sinus infection, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics. He or she also may suggest you use a medicine that you spray into your nose. If allergies are causing your cough, your doctor may advise you to avoid the substances that you're allergic to (allergens) if possible. If you have asthma, try to avoid irritants and allergens that make your asthma worse. Take your asthma medicines as your doctor prescribes. GERD occurs if acid from your stomach backs up into your throat. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine to reduce acid in your stomach. You also may be able to relieve GERD symptoms by waiting 3 to 4 hours after a meal before lying down, and by sleeping with your head raised. Smoking also can cause a chronic cough. If you smoke, it's important to quit. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. Many hospitals have programs that help people quit smoking, or hospital staff can refer you to a program. The Health Topics Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart\" booklet have more information about how to quit smoking. Other causes of a chronic cough include respiratory infections, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and heart failure. Treatments for these causes may include medicines, procedures, and other therapies. Treatment also may include avoiding irritants and allergens and quitting smoking. If your chronic cough is due to a medicine you're taking, your doctor may prescribe a different medicine. Treating the Cough Rather Than the Cause Coughing is important because it helps clear your airways of irritants, such as smoke and mucus (a slimy substance). Coughing also helps prevent infections. Cough medicines usually are used only when the cause of the cough is unknown and the cough causes a lot of discomfort. Medicines can help control a cough and make it easier to cough up mucus. Your doctor may recommend medicines such as: Prescription cough suppressants, also called antitussives. These medicines can help relieve a cough. However, they're usually used when nothing else works. No evidence shows that over-the-counter cough suppressants relieve a cough. Expectorants. These medicines may loosen mucus, making it easier to cough up. Bronchodilators. These medicines relax your airways. Other treatments also may relieve an irritated throat and loosen mucus. Examples include using a cool-mist humidifier or steam vaporizer and drinking enough fluids. Examples of fluids are water, soup, and juice. Ask your doctor how much fluid you need. Cough in Children No evidence shows that cough and cold medicines help children recover more quickly from colds. These medicines can even harm children.

The enlarged prostate crowds its anatomical neighbors, particularly the urethra, causing it to narrow. The narrowed urethra results in several of the symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, or BPH. Symptoms may include a slowed or delayed start in urination, the need to urinate frequently during the night, difficulty in emptying the bladder, a strong, sudden urge to urinate, and incontinence. Less than half of all men with BPH have symptoms of the disease, or their symptoms are minor and do not restrict their life style. BPH is a normal physiological process of aging and treatment options are available.

Many men use saw palmetto to ease symptoms. Some studies have shown that it may help with symptoms, but results are mixed, and more research is needed. If you use saw palmetto and think it works, ask your doctor if you should still take it.SURGERYProstate surgery may be recommended if you have: Incontinence Recurrent blood in the urine Inability to fully empty the bladder (urinary retention) Recurrent urinary tract infections Decreasing kidney function Bladder stones Bothersome symptoms not responding to medicines The choice of which surgical procedure is recommended is most often based on the severity of your symptoms and the size and shape of your prostate gland. Most men who have prostate surgery have improvement in urine flow rates and symptoms.Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP): This is the most common and most proven surgical treatment for BPH. TURP is performed by inserting a scope through the penis and removing the prostate piece by piece.Simple prostatectomy: It is a procedure to remove the inside part of the prostate gland. It is done through a surgical cut in your lower belly. This treatment is most often done on men who have very large prostate glands. Other less-invasive procedures use heat or a laser to destroy prostate tissue. Another less-invasive procedure works by \"tacking\" the prostate open without removing or destroying tissues. None have been proven to be better than TURP. People who receive these procedures are more likely to need surgery again after 5 or 10 years. However, these procedures may be a choice for: Younger men (many of the less-invasive procedures carry a lower risk for impotence and incontinence than TURP, although the risk with TURP is not very high) Older people People with severe medical conditions, including uncontrolled diabetes, cirrhosis, alcoholism, psychosis, and serious lung, kidney, or heart disease Men who are taking blood-thinning drugs Men who are otherwise at an increased surgical risk",

SELF-CARE includes urinating  on a timed schedule,,avoiding alcohol and caffeine, spreading out small portions of fluids during the day, keeping warm and exercising regularly. Avoid stress and cold and sinus medicines, which contain decongestants or antihistamine  that can increase BPH symptoms.  Some studies show that saw palmetto may reduce the symptoms. Other herbs have been tried with mixed results. Drug treatments include Alpha-1 blockers that ease urination by relaxing the muscles of the bladder neck and prostate.

Treatment options include \"watchful waiting,\" lifestyle changes, medicines, or surgery.If you are over 60, you are more likely to have symptoms. But many men with an enlarged prostate have only minor symptoms. Self-care steps are often enough to make you feel better.If you have BPH, you should have a yearly exam to monitor your symptoms and see if you need changes in treatment. SELF-CAREFor mild symptoms: Urinate when you first get the urge. Also, go to the bathroom on a timed schedule, even if you don't feel a need to urinate. Avoid alcohol and caffeine, especially after dinner. DO NOT drink a lot of fluid all at once. Spread out fluids during the day. Avoid drinking fluids within 2 hours of bedtime. Try NOT to take over-the-counter cold and sinus medicines that contain decongestants or antihistamines. These drugs can increase BPH symptoms. Keep warm and exercise regularly. Cold weather and lack of physical activity may worsen symptoms. Reduce stress. Nervousness and tension can lead to more frequent urination. MEDICINESAlpha-1 blockers are a class of drugs that are also used to treat high blood pressure. These medicines relax the muscles of the bladder neck and prostate. This allows easier urination. Most people who take alpha-1 blockers notice improvement in their symptoms, usually within 3 to 7 days after starting the medicine.Finasteride and dutasteride lower levels of hormones produced by the prostate. These drugs also reduce the size of the gland, increase urine flow rate, and decrease symptoms of BPH. You may need to take these medicines for 3 to 6 months before you notice symptoms getting better.
