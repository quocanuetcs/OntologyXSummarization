People affected by this condition may experience a headache and fever for up to 5 days, followed by personality and behavioral changes; seizures ; hallucinations; and altered levels of consciousness. Without early diagnosis and treatment, severe brain damage or even death may occur. Herpes simplex encephalitis is caused by a virus called the herpes simplex virus. Most cases are associated with herpes simplex virus type I (the cause of cold sores or fever blisters), although rare cases can be caused by herpes simplex virus type II (genital herpes). It is poorly understood why some people who are infected with herpes simplex virus develop herpes simplex encephalitis while others do not. Changes ( mutations ) in genes such as TLR3 and TRAF3 have been observed suggesting there may be a genetic component in some cases. Treatment consists of antiviral therapy.[1][2]",

The most common types of diabetic neuropathy result in problems with sensation in the feet. It can develop slowly after many years of diabetes or may occur early in the disease. The symptoms are numbness, pain, or tingling in the feet or lower legs. The pain can be intense and require treatment to relieve the discomfort. The loss of sensation in the feet may also increase the possibility that foot injuries will go unnoticed and develop into ulcers or lesions that become infected. In some cases, diabetic neuropathy can be associated with difficulty walking and some weakness in the foot muscles. There are other types of diabetic-related neuropathies that affect specific parts of the body. For example, diabetic amyotrophy causes pain, weakness and wasting of the thigh muscles, or cranial nerve infarcts that may result in double vision, a drooping eyelid, or dizziness. Diabetes can also affect the autonomic nerves that control blood pressure, the digestive tract, bladder function, and sexual organs.

                "article": "Summary : Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to make images of organs and structures inside the body. How the Test is Performed : An ultrasound machine makes images so that organs inside the body can be examined. The machine sends out high-frequency sound waves, which reflect off body structures. A computer receives the waves and uses them to create a picture. Unlike with an x-ray or CT scan, this test does not use ionizing radiation. The test is done in the ultrasound or radiology department. You will lie down for the test. A clear, water-based gel is applied to the skin on the area to be examined. The gel helps with the transmission of the sound waves. A handheld probe called a transducer is moved over the area being examined. You may need to change position so that other areas can be examined. How to Prepare for the Test : Your preparation will depend on the part of the body being examined. How the Test Will Feel : Most of the time, ultrasound procedures do not cause discomfort. The conducting gel may feel a little cold and wet. Why the Test is Performed : The reason for the test will depend on your symptoms. Normal Results : Results are considered normal if the organs and structures being examined look ok. What Abnormal Results Mean : The meaning of abnormal results will depend on the part of the body being examined and the problem found. Talk to your health care provider about your questions and concerns. Risks : There are no known risks. The test does not use ionizing radiation. Considerations : Some types of ultrasound tests need to be done with a probe that is inserted into your body. Talk to your provider about how your test will be done.",

TN pain is typically felt on one side of the jaw or cheek. Episodes can last for days, weeks, or months at a time and then disappear for months or years. In the days before an episode begins, some patients may experience a tingling or numbing sensation or a somewhat constant and aching pain. The attacks often worsen over time, with fewer and shorter pain-free periods before they recur. The intense flashes of pain can be triggered by vibration or contact with the cheek (such as when shaving, washing the face, or applying makeup), brushing teeth, eating, drinking, talking, or being exposed to the wind. TN occurs most often in people over age 50, but it can occur at any age, and is more common in women than in men. There is some evidence that the disorder runs in families, perhaps because of an inherited pattern of blood vessel formation. Although sometimes debilitating, the disorder is not life-threatening. The presumed cause of TN is a blood vessel pressing on the trigeminal nerve in the head as it exits the brainstem.

This research is now showing results in several areas important to rheumatoid arthritis. Scientists are thinking about RA in exciting ways that were not possible years ago.  Genetics  NIAMS-supported researchers have identified several genetic factors that may make some people more likely to develop rheumatoid arthritis, as well as factors that affect disease severity. Scientists have learned that dozens of genes determine whether a person develops rheumatoid arthritis and how severe the disease will become. Researchers are studying these findings to help identify new treatment approaches for the disease. Researchers are also investigating the potential connection between health, disease, and the human microbiome, which are microorganisms that inhabit the human body, such as the intestines and the mouth. One study found that the presence of a specific type of gut bacteria correlated with rheumatoid arthritis in newly diagnosed, untreated people. Another study has found that bacteria in the mouth can contribute to the autoimmune RA process, indicating that good dental hygiene is important. More work is being done to understand how bacteria interacts with the immune system in the disease.  The Disease Process  NIAMS intramural researchers are studying the natural history of rheumatoid arthritis in children and adults to understand how the disease progresses and affects patient symptoms and functional status. Investigators are also exploring whether patients with rheumatoid arthritis in remission while taking tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-?) inhibitors can remain in remission after tapering the dose of these medications. Most studies so far suggest that taking them away completely leads to flares. However, researchers are studying and identifying what factors predict who will relapse when treatments are reduced. Scientists are continuing to understand what happens at the molecular level in rheumatoid arthritis and are working to develop tests that could help diagnose RA earlier and identify patients who would benefit most from specific treatments.  Joint inflammation.  NIAMS-funded researchers have determined that joint inflammation can continue in rheumatoid arthritis even after clinical symptoms have eased. This finding may help doctors determine when a patient is truly in remission and can safely stop treatment.  New Therapies  To date, there is still no cure for RA. Researchers continue to identify turned on genes and molecules that contribute to the development and worsening of rheumatoid arthritis and thus are potential targets for new treatments. The path between identifying the molecule and developing a drug that targets it is long and difficult. Fortunately, several new medications for RA have emerged over the past 20 years that substantially reduce symptoms and damage in rheumatoid arthritis. However, over time, medications may stop working for some people, creating a need for new advanced therapies. Researchers continue to identify more candidate drugs, with hopes that these will have fewer side effects or will cure more patients.

Researchers continue to identify turned on genes and molecules that contribute to the development and worsening of rheumatoid arthritis and thus are potential targets for new treatments. The path between identifying the molecule and developing a drug that targets it is long and difficult. Fortunately, several new medications for RA have emerged over the past 20 years that substantially reduce symptoms and damage in rheumatoid arthritis. However, over time, medications may stop working for some people, creating a need for new advanced therapies. Researchers continue to identify more candidate drugs, with hopes that these will have fewer side effects or will cure more patients.  National Institutes of Health Accelerating Medicines Partnership.  The NIAMS and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases are leading the Accelerating Medicines Partnership in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (AMP RA/SLE). The AMP RA/SLE consortium is a unique public?private partnership that was created to find new ways to identify and validate promising biological targets for diagnostics and drug development. Over the last several decades, research has greatly increased our understanding of the immune system, genetics, and biology. This research is now showing results in several areas important to rheumatoid arthritis. Scientists are thinking about RA in exciting ways that were not possible years ago.  Genetics  NIAMS-supported researchers have identified several genetic factors that may make some people more likely to develop rheumatoid arthritis, as well as factors that affect disease severity. Scientists have learned that dozens of genes determine whether a person develops rheumatoid arthritis and how severe the disease will become. Researchers are studying these findings to help identify new treatment approaches for the disease. Researchers are also investigating the potential connection between health, disease, and the human microbiome, which are microorganisms that inhabit the human body, such as the intestines and the mouth. One study found that the presence of a specific type of gut bacteria correlated with rheumatoid arthritis in newly diagnosed, untreated people. Another study has found that bacteria in the mouth can contribute to the autoimmune RA process, indicating that good dental hygiene is important. More work is being done to understand how bacteria interacts with the immune system in the disease.  The Disease Process  NIAMS intramural researchers are studying the natural history of rheumatoid arthritis in children and adults to understand how the disease progresses and affects patient symptoms and functional status. Investigators are also exploring whether patients with rheumatoid arthritis in remission while taking tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-?) inhibitors can remain in remission after tapering the dose of these medications. Most studies so far suggest that taking them away completely leads to flares. However, researchers are studying and identifying what factors predict who will relapse when treatments are reduced. Scientists are continuing to understand what happens at the molecular level in rheumatoid arthritis and are working to develop tests that could help diagnose RA earlier and identify patients who would benefit most from specific treatments.

                "article": "NSAIDs are commonly used to treat the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. They do not prevent the damage caused by rheumatoid arthritis from progressing and thus should not be considered the primary treatment. (See also table Drugs Used to Treat Rheumatoid Arthritis.)NSAIDs can reduce the swelling in affected joints and relieve pain. They can be taken by mouth or applied directly to the skin over painful joints. Rheumatoid arthritis, unlike osteoarthritis, causes considerable inflammation. Thus, drugs that decrease inflammation, including NSAIDs, have an important advantage over drugs such as acetaminophen that reduce pain but not inflammation. However, NSAIDs (except cyclooxygenase inhibitors) should not be taken by people who have active digestive tract (peptic) ulcersincluding stomach ulcers or duodenal ulcersbecause NSAIDs can upset the stomach. Drugs called proton pump inhibitors (such as esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole) can reduce the risk of stomach or duodenal ulcers (see table Drugs Used to Treat Peptic Ulcer Disease).Other possible side effects of NSAIDs may include headache, confusion, increased blood pressure, worsening of high blood pressure, worsening of kidney function, swelling, and decreased platelet function. People who get hives, inflammation and swelling in the nose, or asthma after they take aspirin may have the same symptoms after taking other NSAIDs. NSAIDs may increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. The risk appears to be higher if the drug is used at higher doses and for longer periods of time. The risk is higher with certain NSAIDs than others.Aspirin is no longer used to treat rheumatoid arthritis because effective doses are often toxic.The  cyclooxygenase (COX-2) inhibitors  (coxibs, such as celecoxib) are NSAIDs that act similarly to the other NSAIDs but are slightly less likely to damage the stomach. However, if a person also takes aspirin, stomach damage is almost as likely to occur as with other NSAIDs. Caution should be taken with use of coxibs and probably all NSAIDs for long periods or by people with risk factors for heart attack and stroke.",

                "article": "Xeroderma pigmentosum, which is commonly known as XP, is an inherited condition characterized by an extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight. This condition mostly affects the eyes and areas of skin exposed to the sun. Some affected individuals also have problems involving the nervous system. The signs of xeroderma pigmentosum usually appear in infancy or early childhood. Many affected children develop a severe sunburn after spending just a few minutes in the sun. The sunburn causes redness and blistering that can last for weeks. Other affected children do not get sunburned with minimal sun exposure, but instead tan normally. By age 2, almost all children with xeroderma pigmentosum develop freckling of the skin in sun-exposed areas (such as the face, arms, and lips); this type of freckling rarely occurs in young children without the disorder. In affected individuals, exposure to sunlight often causes dry skin (xeroderma) and changes in skin coloring (pigmentation). This combination of features gives the condition its name, xeroderma pigmentosum. People with xeroderma pigmentosum have a greatly increased risk of developing skin cancer. Without sun protection, about half of children with this condition develop their first skin cancer by age 10. Most people with xeroderma pigmentosum develop multiple skin cancers during their lifetime. These cancers occur most often on the face, lips, and eyelids. Cancer can also develop on the scalp, in the eyes, and on the tip of the tongue. Studies suggest that people with xeroderma pigmentosum may also have an increased risk of other types of cancer, including brain tumors. Additionally, affected individuals who smoke cigarettes have a significantly increased risk of lung cancer. The eyes of people with xeroderma pigmentosum may be painfully sensitive to UV rays from the sun. If the eyes are not protected from the sun, they may become bloodshot and irritated, and the clear front covering of the eyes (the cornea) may become cloudy. In some people, the eyelashes fall out and the eyelids may be thin and turn abnormally inward or outward. In addition to an increased risk of eye cancer, xeroderma pigmentosum is associated with noncancerous growths on the eye. Many of these eye abnormalities can impair vision. About 30 percent of people with xeroderma pigmentosum develop progressive neurological abnormalities in addition to problems involving the skin and eyes. These abnormalities can include hearing loss, poor coordination, difficulty walking, movement problems, loss of intellectual function, difficulty swallowing and talking, and seizures. When these neurological problems occur, they tend to worsen with time. Researchers have identified at least eight inherited forms of xeroderma pigmentosum: complementation group A (XP-A) through complementation group G (XP-G) plus a variant type (XP-V). The types are distinguished by their genetic cause. All of the types increase skin cancer risk, although some are more likely than others to be associated with neurological abnormalities.",

                "article": "Xeroderma pigmentosum is caused by mutations in genes that are involved in repairing damaged DNA. DNA can be damaged by UV rays from the sun and by toxic chemicals such as those found in cigarette smoke. Normal cells are usually able to fix DNA damage before it causes problems. However, in people with xeroderma pigmentosum, DNA damage is not repaired normally. As more abnormalities form in DNA, cells malfunction and eventually become cancerous or die.Many of the genes related to xeroderma pigmentosum are part of a DNA-repair process known as nucleotide excision repair (NER). The proteins produced from these genes play a variety of roles in this process. They recognize DNA damage, unwind regions of DNA where the damage has occurred, snip out (excise) the abnormal sections, and replace the damaged areas with the correct DNA. Inherited abnormalities in the NER-related genes prevent cells from carrying out one or more of these steps. The POLH gene also plays a role in protecting cells from UV-induced DNA damage, although it is not involved in NER; mutations in this gene cause the variant type of xeroderma pigmentosum.The major features of xeroderma pigmentosum result from a buildup of unrepaired DNA damage. When UV rays damage genes that control cell growth and division, cells can either die or grow too fast and in an uncontrolled way. Unregulated cell growth can lead to the development of cancerous tumors. Neurological abnormalities are also thought to result from an accumulation of DNA damage, although the brain is not exposed to UV rays. Researchers suspect that other factors damage DNA in nerve cells. It is unclear why some people with xeroderma pigmentosum develop neurological abnormalities and others do not.Inherited mutations in at least eight genes have been found to cause xeroderma pigmentosum. More than half of all cases in the United States result from mutations in the XPC, ERCC2, or POLH genes. Mutations in the other genes generally account for a smaller percentage of cases.",

Some of the strategies employed in the management of XP include:[2][3][4] Protection from ultraviolet light Frequent skin and eye examinations Prompt removal of cancerous tissue Neurological examination Psychosocial care Small, premalignant skin lesions such as actinic keratoses can be frozen with liquid nitrogen. Larger areas of sun-damaged skin can be treated with topical 5-fluorouracil or imiquimod. In rare cases, therapeutic dermatome shaving or dermabrasion is used to remove damaged superficial epidermal layers. Skin cancers can be treated using standard treatment protocols, including electrodesiccation and curettage (scrapes away the lesion and uses electricity to kill any remaining cells ), surgical excision, or chemosurgery. High dose oral isotretinoin or acitretin can be used to prevent new cancers. Cancers of the eyelids, conjunctiva, and cornea are usually treated surgically.

To protect your child from the exposure, always use sunscreen with the highest SPF, long-sleeve shirts and pants. Teach your child to always wear sunglasses when outdoors. Without protection, half of the children with XP develop skin cancer by the age of 10. The doctors could prescribe retinoid creams and other medicines to protect the skin. if skin cancer develops, it could be surgically removed.

About 30 percent of people with xeroderma pigmentosum develop progressive neurological abnormalities in addition to problems involving the skin and eyes. These abnormalities can include hearing loss, poor coordination, difficulty walking, movement problems, loss of intellectual function, difficulty swallowing and talking, and seizures. It is unclear why some people with xeroderma pigmentosum develop neurological abnormalities and others do not.  People with XP need total protection from sunlight. Even the light coming through windows or from fluorescent bulbs can be dangerous.When out in the sun, protective clothing must be worn.To protect the skin and eyes from the sunlight: Use sunscreen with the highest SPF you can find. Wear long-sleeve shirts and long pants. Wear sunglasses that block UVA and UVB rays. Teach your child to always wear sunglasses when outdoors. To prevent skin cancer, the provider may prescribe medicines, such as a retinoid cream, to apply to the skin.If skin cancer develops, surgery or other methods will be done to remove the cancer. Without sun protection, about half of children with this condition develop their first skin cancer by age 10. Most people with xeroderma pigmentosum develop multiple skin cancers during their lifetime. These cancers occur most often on the face, lips, and eyelids. Cancer can also develop on the scalp, in the eyes, and on the tip of the tongue.  There is no cure for XP, but there are ways to prevent and treat some of the problems associated with it.  Small, premalignant skin lesions such as actinic keratoses can be frozen with liquid nitrogen. Larger areas of sun-damaged skin can be treated with topical 5-fluorouracil or imiquimod. In rare cases, therapeutic dermatome shaving or dermabrasion is used to remove damaged superficial epidermal layers. Skin cancers can be treated using standard treatment protocols, including electrodesiccation and curettage (scrapes away the lesion and uses electricity to kill any remaining cells ), surgical excision, or chemosurgery.

                "article": "Vitiligo is a relatively common pigmentation disorder in which the skin's pigment-making cells (melanocytes) are lost or destroyed. As a result, well-defined white patches appear on the skin. Patches may occur on one section or all over the body and may join together (coalesce).[1] Some people also have loss of pigment in patches of hair on the head or body. Vitiligo tends to continue over time, causing larger areas of skin to lose pigment. It may begin at any age but the average age of onset is in the mid-twenties.[2] Vitiligo does not affect physical health, but concerns about appearance and ethnic identity can lead to serious psychological, social, and emotional difficulties, significantly impacting quality of life.[1][3][2] The specific cause of vitiligo is not known. Many people with vitiligo also have a personal or family history of autoimmune disease , suggesting that vitiligo has an autoimmune cause. It sometimes \"runs in families,\" suggesting that genetics may play a role. People with vitiligo often report that its onset was related to a specific triggering event, such as injury, illness, sunburn, emotional stress, or pregnancy. However, there are currently no data supporting that these factors cause vitiligo.[1] There is no cure for vitiligo, but available treatments may stop its progression and induce varying degrees of re-pigmentation. Treatment options vary depending on severity and preference and may include topical, systemic, and/or light-based therapies. A combination of therapies is usually more effective than a single therapy. Despite the availability of treatment, the course of the condition and response to treatment are unpredictable.[3]",

Symptoms can vary depending on the metal involved, the amount absorbed, and the age of the person exposed.[2] For example, young children are more susceptible to the effects of lead exposure because they absorb more compared with adults and their brains are still developing.[2] Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are common symptoms of acute metal ingestion.

In addition to the skin, the teeth, nails, white of the eyes (sclera), and lining of the mouth (mucosa) may be discolored.  Some oil paints have heavy metals such as lead, mercury, cobalt, and barium added as pigment. These heavy metals can cause additional poisoning if swallowed in large amounts. Heavy metal poisoning refers to when excessive exposure to a heavy metal affects the normal function of the body. Examples of heavy metals that can cause toxicity include lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, and chromium. Symptoms can vary depending on the metal involved, the amount absorbed, and the age of the person exposed. For example, young children are more susceptible to the effects of lead exposure because they absorb more compared with adults and their brains are still developing. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are common symptoms of acute metal ingestion. Chronic exposure may cause various symptoms resulting from damage to body organs , and may increase the risk of cancer. Treatment depends on the circumstances of the exposure.",

                "article": "Besides bladder control training, you may want to talk with your doctor about other ways to help manage incontinence:- Medicines can help the bladder empty more fully during urination. Other drugs tighten muscles and can lessen leakage. Some women find that using an estrogen vaginal cream may help relieve stress or urge incontinence. A low dose of estrogen cream is applied directly to the vaginal walls and urethral tissue. A doctor may inject a substance that thickens the area around the urethra to help close the bladder opening. This can reduce stress incontinence in women. This treatment may need to be repeated. Some women may be able to use a medical device, such as a urethral insert, a small disposable device inserted into the urethra. A pessary, a stiff ring inserted into the vagina, may help prevent leaking if you have a prolapsed bladder or vagina. Nerve stimulation, which sends mild electric current to the nerves around the bladder that help control urination, may be another option. Surgery can sometimes improve or cure incontinence if it's caused by a change in the position of the bladder or blockage due to an enlarged prostate.Even after treatment, some people still leak urine from time to time. There are bladder control products and other solutions, including adult diapers, furniture pads, urine deodorizing pills, and special skin cleansers that may make leaking urine bother you a little less.Visit the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases for more information on urinary incontinence in men and urinary incontinence in women.Read about this topic in Spanish.

                "article": "Regardless of the type and cause of incontinence, some general measures are usually helpful. Modifying fluid intake Bladder training Pelvic muscle exercises  Fluid intake  can be limited at certain times (for example, before going out or 3 to 4 hours before bedtime). Doctors may suggest that people avoid fluids that irritate the bladder (such as caffeine-containing fluids). However, people should drink 48 to 64 oz (15  to 2  mL) of fluid a day because concentrated urine irritates the bladder. Bladder training  is a technique that involves having the person follow a fixed schedule for urination while awake. The doctor works with the person to establish a schedule of urinating every 2 to 3 hours and suppressing the urge to urinate at other times (for example, by relaxing and breathing deeply). As the person becomes better able to suppress the urge to urinate, the interval is gradually lengthened. A similar technique, called prompted voiding, can be used by people who care for a person with dementia or other cognitive problems. In this, the person is asked whether they need to urinate and whether they are wet or dry at specific intervals. Pelvic muscle exercises  (Kegel exercises) are often effective, especially for stress incontinence. People must be certain to exercise the correct muscles, the muscles around the urethra and rectum that stop the flow of urine. The muscles are tightly squeezed for 1 to 2 seconds and then relaxed for about 10 seconds. The exercises are repeated about 10 times three times each day. People are gradually able to increase the time the muscles are tightly squeezed until the contraction is held for about 10 seconds each time. Because it can be difficult to learn to control the correct muscles, doctors may need to provide instruction or recommend the use of biofeedback or electrical stimulation (an electronic version of pelvic floor exercises in which an electric current is used to stimulate the correct muscles).TableSome Drugs Used to Treat Urinary Incontinence Drug How It Works Comments For weakness of the urinary sphincter or pelvic muscles (bladder outlet incompetence) causing stress incontinence Duloxetine Helps strengthen contractions of the urinary sphincter Not as thoroughly studied as many other drugs Not approved for this use in the United States Imipramine (a tricyclic antidepressant) Helps strengthen urinary sphincter contractions and relax an overactive bladder (an anticholinergic effect*) Also used for overactive bladder and urge incontinence FDA approved as temporary therapy for reducing nighttime incontinence (enuresis) in children aged 6 years and older Pseudoephedrine (an alpha-adrenergic stimulant) Helps strengthen urinary sphincter contractions Can cause anxiety, insomnia, and, in men, inability to urinate OTC medication used primarily as a decongestant For bladder outlet obstruction in men causing urge or overflow incontinence Alpha-adrenergic blockers: Alfuzosin Doxazosin Prazosin Silodosin Tamsulosin Terazosin Help relax the urinary sphincter Tend to increase the speed of urine flow and help the bladder empty more completely May decrease blood pressure or cause fatigue 5-Alpha reductase inhibitors: Dutasteride Finasteride Help shrink an enlarged prostate Can take weeks or months to become effective Sometimes decrease sex drive or contribute to erectile dysfunction Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor: Tadalafil Doctors are not certain how this drug affects an enlarged prostate Low dose taken daily (also used to treat erectile dysfunction) For overactive bladder with urge or stress incontinence Darifenacin Increases the bladder's filling capacity and decreases bladder wall muscle spasms (anticholinergic effects) Dicyclomine Relaxes involuntary muscles Increases the bladder's filling capacity and decreases bladder wall muscle spasms (anticholinergic effects*) Not as thoroughly studied as many other drugs Fesoterodine Increases the bladder's filling capacity and decreases bladder wall muscle spasms (anticholinergic effects) Not as thoroughly studied as many other drugs Hyoscyamine Increases the bladder's filling capacity and decreases bladder wall muscle spasms (anticholinergic effects*) Not as thoroughly studied as many other drugs Imipramine (a tricyclic antidepressant) Helps strengthen urinary sphincter contractions Increases the bladder's filling capacity and decreases bladder wall muscle spasms (an anticholinergic effect*) Particularly useful for nighttime incontinence Mirabegron (a beta-adrenergic stimulant) Relaxes the bladder wall Not as thoroughly studied as many other drugs May increase blood pressure OnabotulinumtoxinA (a type of botulinum toxin) Blocks the nerve activity in the bladder muscle that causes the bladder to contract involuntarily Injected into the bladder wall through a cystoscope inserted in the bladder Used to treat incontinence in adults with overactive bladder caused by a neurologic disorder (such as multiple sclerosis) when other drugs are ineffective or have too many side effects Oxybutynin Many effects, such as relaxation of involuntary muscles and anticholinergic effects*, which include increasing the bladder's filling capacity and decreasing the bladder wall muscle spasms May be the most effective drug Available as a tablet, skin patch, and gel Solifenacin Increases the bladder's filling capacity and decreases bladder wall muscle spasms (anticholinergic effects) Tolterodine Increases the bladder's filling capacity and decreases bladder wall muscle spasms (anticholinergic effects) Trospium Increases the bladder's filling capacity and decreases bladder wall muscle spasms (anticholinergic effects*) For weak bladder wall muscles with overflow incontinence Bethanechol Helps bladder wall muscles contract Usually ineffective Can cause flushing, abdominal cramps, and an increased heart rate * Anticholinergic effects (such as dry mouth, constipation, and sometimes blurred vision or confusion) can be bothersome, particularly in older people.

Each infected follicle is itchy or slightly painful, but the person otherwise does not feel sick.Some people develop folliculitis after exposure to a poorly chlorinated hot tub or whirlpool. This condition, sometimes called hot tub folliculitis or hot tub dermatitis, is caused by the bacterium  Pseudomonas aeruginosa . It begins anytime from 6 hours to 5 days after the exposure. Areas of skin covered by a bathing suit, such as the torso and buttocks, are the most common sites.Some people develop mild folliculitis in areas subjected to moisture and friction, such as areas under sports equipment or on the buttocks.Infected hairs easily fall out or may be plucked out, but new pimples tend to develop.Sometimes stiff hairs in the beard area curl and reenter the skin (ingrown hair) after shaving, causing mild irritation and inflammation. However, there is no actual infection.

                "article": "The abdominal organs, such as the stomach and intestines, are inside a large hollow space called the abdominal cavity. The peritoneum is a membrane that lines the abdominal cavity and covers the abdominal organs. In peritoneal dialysis, that membrane acts as a filter. This membrane has a large surface area and a rich network of blood vessels. Substances from the blood can easily pass through the peritoneum into the abdominal (peritoneal) cavity. A fluid (dialysate) is infused through a catheter inserted through the abdominal wall into the peritoneal space within the abdomen. The dialysate must be left in the abdomen for a sufficient time to allow waste products from the bloodstream to pass slowly into it. Then the dialysate is drained out, discarded, and replaced with fresh dialysate.A soft silicone rubber or porous polyurethane catheter allows the dialysate to flow smoothly and is unlikely to cause damage. A catheter can be put in place temporarily at the persons bedside, or it may be surgically put in place permanently. One type of permanent catheter eventually forms a seal with the skin and can be capped when not in use.Peritoneal dialysis can be done using a machine (called automated peritoneal dialysis) or without one (using manual techniques). Manual peritoneal dialysis  techniques are the simplest. No machine is used. There are two types: In manual intermittent peritoneal dialysis, bags containing dialysate are warmed to body temperature and infused into the peritoneal (abdominal) cavity, which takes about 10 minutes. The dialysate is allowed to remain there (dwell time) for 60 to 90 minutes and then is drained out in about 10 to 20 minutes. This process is then repeated. The entire treatment can take 12 to 24 hours. Between periods of dialysis, there is no dialysate in the peritoneal cavity. In continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, the dialysate is usually drained and replenished 4 or 5 times per day. Generally, 3 of these dialysate exchanges are done during the day, with dwell times of 4 hours or longer. An exchange is done at night with a long dwell time of 8 to 12 hours during sleep. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis differs from intermittent peritoneal dialysis in that there is always dialysate in the peritoneal cavity.  Automated peritoneal dialysis  techniques are becoming the most commonly used forms of peritoneal dialysis. In automated peritoneal dialysis, an automated device does multiple exchanges during the night while the person sleeps. These techniques minimize the number of exchanges during the day but prevent mobility at night because of cumbersome equipment. Sometimes a daytime exchange time is used. Automated peritoneal dialysis techniques are further divided into three subcategories: Continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis uses a long (12- to 15-hour) daytime dwell period and 3 to 6 nighttime exchanges done with an automated cycler. Nocturnal intermittent peritoneal dialysis uses exchanges done with a cycler at night while the person's peritoneal cavity is left without dialysate fluid during the day. Tidal peritoneal dialysis is a modification in which some of the dialysate fluid is left in the peritoneal cavity from one exchange to the next. This technique may be more comfortable for the person. Tidal peritoneal dialysis may be done with or without a daytime dwell period. Some people require a combination of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis to achieve adequate removal of waste products from their blood.TableSome Common Complications of Peritoneal Dialysis Complication Cause Low blood pressure Loss of too much fluid and salt during dialysis Bleeding Unintentional perforation of an internal organ during placement of the catheter Removal of the catheter from the body Irritation and inflammation of the membrane that lines the abdomen (peritoneum) or the area around the insertion site (when the catheter does not seal to the abdominal wall) Infection Unsterile techniques during dialysis Low level of albumin (a protein) in the blood Loss of protein in fluid removed during dialysis along with inadequate protein in diet Scarring of the peritoneum* Inflammation and infection Electrolytes in the dialysis fluid Use of certain drugs A high sugar (glucose) level in the blood Use of a peritoneal dialysate that has a high concentration of glucose (used to remove water and sodium during dialysis) Hernias in the abdomen or groin Increased pressure within the abdomen caused by continued exposure to high fluid levels, which weaken the barriers that normally prevent excessive movement of organs and other structures Constipation Intake of inadequate fiber or use of calcium salts to treat high phosphate levels in the blood, causing the intestine to widen, which possibly interferes with dialysate flow in and out of the abdomen *The peritoneum acts as a filter in peritoneal dialysis. When the peritoneum is scarred, fluids and waste products can no longer readily pass through it to be removed.",

Peritoneal dialysis is better tolerated than hemodialysis in people whose blood pressure fluctuates frequently between periods of high or normal pressure and periods of low blood pressure.The most common and troublesome complications of peritoneal dialysis are infection of the peritoneal fluid (causing inflammation of the peritoneum, called peritonitis) and infection of the area where the catheter enters the skin (insertion site). Peritonitis may cause constant, sharp, severe pain throughout the abdomen, but sometimes causes little pain. Infection at the insertion site causes redness of the skin and pain at the insertion site. Such infections can be treated with antibiotics and careful wound care.Comparing Hemodialysis With Peritoneal Dialysis When the kidneys fail, waste products and excess water can be removed from the blood by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. In hemodialysis, blood is removed from the body into a dialyzer (called an artificial kidney), which filters the blood. An artificial connection between an artery and a vein (arteriovenous fistula) is made to facilitate the removal of blood. In peritoneal dialysis, the peritoneum is used as a filter.

                "article": "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of genetic conditions that can be caused by a change ( mutation ) in several different genes :[2] 21-hydroxylase deficiency is caused by mutations in the gene 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency is caused by mutations in the gene 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency is caused by mutations in the gene Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency is caused by mutations in the gene 17-hydroxylase deficiency is caused by mutations in the CYP17A1 gene Congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia is caused by mutations in the STAR gene Most of these genes encode enzymes that the adrenal glands need to make one or more hormones . The adrenal glands are cone-shaped organs that sit on top of the kidneys and are responsible for releasing various types of hormones that the body needs to function. Mutations in these genes lead to deficient levels of enzymes which cause low levels of hormones such as cortisol and/or aldosterone and an overproduction of androgens (male hormones such as testosterone). Cortisol is a hormone that affects energy levels, blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and the body's response to stress, illness, and injury. Aldosterone helps the body maintain the proper level of sodium (salt) and water and helps maintain blood pressure. Irregular levels of these hormones lead to the signs and symptoms of CAH.[3][4]",

For example, girls with the severe form of CAH may be born with ambiguous genitalia, which often allows the condition to be diagnosed before other associated health problems such as poor feeding, vomiting, dehydration, and abnormal heart beat, can develop. Males typically appear unaffected at birth even when they have a severe form of CAH and without proper diagnosis, will develop associated health problems within 2-3 weeks after birth. Both genders can experience other symptoms such as early onset of puberty, fast body growth, and premature completion of growth leading to short stature , if they are not treated in early life.[4][1][2] People affected by milder forms may not have any signs and symptoms of CAH during childhood. In these cases, a diagnosis may not be made until adolescence or adulthood when the affected person experiences early signs of puberty or fertility problems. Females with this type may have excessive facial or body hair; irregular menstrual periods; and/or acne.[4][1][2] There are two main types of CAH: classic CAH, the more severe form, and a milder form called nonclassic CAH.

The prevalence is higher is other parts of the world. All forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.  Shortly after birth, all newborns in the United States are screened for a variety of conditions, including 21-hydroxylase deficiency. This is the most common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and accounts for 95% of classic CAH cases. Nonclassic CAH is not detected through newborn screening and is often not suspected until signs and symptoms of the condition begin to appear later in childhood or early adulthood. In these cases, a diagnosis of CAH is usually based on physical examination; blood and urine tests that measure hormone levels; and/or genetic testing. An X-ray may also be helpful in confirming the diagnosis in children since CAH can cause bones to grow and develop more quickly than usual (advanced bone age) . The signs and symptoms present in each person depend on many factors including the type of CAH, the age of diagnosis, and the sex of the affected person. For example, females with a severe form of the condition may have ambiguous genitalia at birth and if not properly diagnosed, develop dehydration, poor feeding, diarrhea, vomiting and other health problems soon after. People with milder forms may not be diagnosed with the condition until adolescence or adulthood when they experience early signs of puberty or fertility problems. Treatment for CAH varies but may include medication and/or surgery.  Many people with CAH require steroids to replace the low hormones .

Rheumatoid arthritis may start causing joint damage during the first year or two that a person has the disease, so early diagnosis and treatment are very important.  Medications  Most people who have RA take medications. Studies show that early treatment with combinations of medications, instead of one medication alone, may be more effective in decreasing or preventing joint damage. Many of the medications that doctors prescribe to treat RA help decrease inflammation and pain, and slow or stop joint damage. They may include: Anti-inflammatory medications to provide pain relief and lower inflammation. Corticosteroids that can help decrease inflammation, provide some pain relief, and slow joint damage. Because they are potent drugs, your doctor will prescribe the lowest dose possible to achieve the desired benefit. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) that can help to slow or change the progression of the disease. Biologic response modifiers if your disease is more severe. These medications target specific immune messages and interrupt the signal, helping to decrease or stop inflammation. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, which send messages to specific cells to stop inflammation from inside the cell.  Surgery  Your doctor may recommend surgery if you have permanent damage or pain that limits your ability to perform day-to-day activities. Surgery is not for everyone. You and your doctor can discuss the options and choose what is right for you. Your doctor will consider the following before recommending surgery: Your overall health.

The most common signs and symptoms are pain, swelling, and stiffness of the joints. Small joints in the hands and feet are involved most often, although larger joints (such as the shoulders, hips, and knees) may become involved later in the disease. Joints are typically affected in a symmetrical pattern; for example, if joints in the hand are affected, both hands tend to be involved. People with rheumatoid arthritis often report that their joint pain and stiffness is worse when getting out of bed in the morning or after a long rest. Rheumatoid arthritis can also cause inflammation of other tissues and organs, including the eyes, lungs, and blood vessels. Additional signs and symptoms of the condition can include a loss of energy, a low fever, weight loss, and a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Some affected individuals develop rheumatoid nodules, which are firm lumps of noncancerous tissue that can grow under the skin and elsewhere in the body. The signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis usually appear in mid- to late adulthood. Many affected people have episodes of symptoms (flares) followed by periods with no symptoms (remissions) for the rest of their lives. In severe cases, affected individuals have continuous health problems related to the disease for many years. The abnormal inflammation can lead to severe joint damage, which limits movement and can cause significant disability.",

Self-care can help you play a role in managing your RA and improving your health. You can: Learn about rheumatoid arthritis and its treatments. Use exercises and relaxation techniques to reduce your pain and keeping you active. Communicate well with your health care team so you can have more control over your disease. Reach out for support to help cope with the physical emotional, and mental effects of rheumatoid arthritis. Participating in your care can help build confidence in your ability to perform day-to-day activities, allowing you to lead a full, active, and independent life.  Lifestyle Changes  Certain activities can help improve your ability to function on your own and maintain a positive outlook. Rest and exercise. Balance your rest and exercise, with more rest when your RA is active and more exercise when it is not. Rest helps to decrease active joint inflammation, pain, and fatigue. In general, shorter rest breaks every now and then are more helpful than long times spent in bed. Exercise is important for maintaining healthy and strong muscles, preserving joint mobility, and maintaining flexibility. Exercise can help: Improve your sleep. Decrease pain. Keep a positive attitude. Maintain a healthy weight. Doctors usually recommend low-impact exercises, such as water exercise programs. Talk to your health care providers before beginning any exercise program. Joint care. Some people find wearing a splint for a short time around a painful joint reduces pain and swelling. People use splints mostly on wrists and hands, but also on ankles and feet. Talk to your doctor or a physical or occupational therapist before wearing a splint. Other ways you can protect your joints include: Using self-help devices, such as items with a large grip, zipper pullers, or long-handled shoehorns. Using tools or devices that help with activities of daily living, such as an adaptive toothbrush or silverware. Using devices to help you get on and off chairs, toilet seats, and beds. Choosing activities that put less stress on your joints, such as limiting the use of the stairs or taking rest periods when walking longer distances. Maintaining a healthy weight to help lower the stress on your joints. Monitoring of symptoms. It is important to monitor your symptoms for any changes or the development of new symptoms. Understanding your symptoms and how they may change can help you and your doctor manage your pain when you have a flare. Stress management. The emotions you may feel because of RA fear, anger, and frustration, along with any pain, physical limitations, and the unpredictable nature of flares can increase your stress level. Although there is no evidence that stress plays a role in causing rheumatoid arthritis, it can make living with the disease more difficult. Stress also may affect the amount of pain you feel. Ways to cope with stress can include: Regular rest periods. Relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditating, or listening to quiet sounds or music. Movement exercise programs, such as yoga and tai chi. Mental health management. Living with RA can be hard and isolating. If you feel alone, anxious, or depressed about having the disease, talk to your doctor, an RA support social worker, or mental health professional. Keep the lines of communication open. Talk to family and friends about your RA to help them understand the disease. You may find it helpful to join an online or community support group. Healthy diet. A healthy and nutritious diet that includes a balance of calories, protein, and calcium is important for maintaining overall health. Talk to your doctor about drinking alcoholic beverages because they may interact with the medications you take for rheumatoid arthritis. Before making any changes to your diet or activity, talk to your doctor. Research shows that people who take part in their own care report less pain and make fewer doctor visits.

Choosing activities that put less stress on your joints, such as limiting the use of the stairs or taking rest periods when walking longer distances. Maintaining a healthy weight to help lower the stress on your joints. Monitoring of symptoms. It is important to monitor your symptoms for any changes or the development of new symptoms. Understanding your symptoms and how they may change can help you and your doctor manage your pain when you have a flare. Stress management. The emotions you may feel because of RA fear, anger, and frustration, along with any pain, physical limitations, and the unpredictable nature of flares can increase your stress level. Although there is no evidence that stress plays a role in causing rheumatoid arthritis, it can make living with the disease more difficult. Stress also may affect the amount of pain you feel. Ways to cope with stress can include: Regular rest periods. Relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditating, or listening to quiet sounds or music. Movement exercise programs, such as yoga and tai chi. Mental health management. Living with RA can be hard and isolating. If you feel alone, anxious, or depressed about having the disease, talk to your doctor, an RA support social worker, or mental health professional. Keep the lines of communication open. Talk to family and friends about your RA to help them understand the disease. You may find it helpful to join an online or community support group. Healthy diet. A healthy and nutritious diet that includes a balance of calories, protein, and calcium is important for maintaining overall health. Talk to your doctor about drinking alcoholic beverages because they may interact with the medications you take for rheumatoid arthritis. Before making any changes to your diet or activity, talk to your doctor.",

Many affected people have episodes of symptoms (flares) followed by periods with no symptoms (remissions) for the rest of their lives. Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis continues to improve, which can give many people relief from symptoms, improving their quality of life. Your doctor may recommend a combination of treatments, which may change over time based on your symptoms and the severity of your disease. No matter which treatment plan your doctor recommends, the goals are to help: Relieve pain. Decrease inflammation and swelling. Prevent, slow, or stop joint and organ damage. Improve your ability to participate in daily activities.  Participating in your care can help build confidence in your ability to perform day-to-day activities, allowing you to lead a full, active, and independent life. Certain activities can help improve your ability to function on your own and maintain a positive outlook.  Balance your rest and exercise, with more rest when your RA is active and more exercise when it is not. Rest helps to decrease active joint inflammation, pain, and fatigue. In general, shorter rest breaks every now and then are more helpful than long times spent in bed.

A shortage of testosterone can lead to delayed or incomplete puberty, breast enlargement (gynecomastia), reduced facial and body hair, and an inability to have biological children (infertility). Some affected individuals also have genital differences including undescended testes (cryptorchidism), the opening of the urethra on the underside of the penis (hypospadias), or an unusually small penis (micropenis). Older children and adults with Klinefelter syndrome tend to be taller than their peers. Compared with unaffected men, adults with Klinefelter syndrome have an increased risk of developing breast cancer and a chronic inflammatory disease called systemic lupus erythematosus. Their chance of developing these disorders is similar to that of women in the general population.

In the areas other than genitals, UV light could be used. Outlook for surgery  in men (mostly circumcision)  is good, as the disease usually does not come back.

        "multi_ext_summ": "Lichen sclerosus is a long-term problem that usually affects the skin in the genital and anal areas. Sometimes, lichen sclerosus appears on the upper body, breasts, and upper arms. The disease does not cause skin cancer but may increase your likelihood of developing it if your skin is scarred. You should see your doctor every 6 to 12 months in order to follow and treat and skin changes.  Patches on the arms or upper body usually dont need treatment. They will go away over time. Patches of the genital skin should be treated, even if they arent painful or itchy. These patches can scar, causing problems with urination or sex.  Possible treatments for lichen sclerosus include: Surgery. Circumcision is the most widely used therapy for men with lichen sclerosus, and the disease does not usually come back after this procedure. However, surgery is not a good option for women, as the disease usually comes back after lichen sclerosus patches are removed from their genitals.  If the vaginal opening has narrowed, dilators may be needed. In rare cases, surgery is necessary to allow for sexual intercourse.  Medications, including strong cortisone creams or ointments on the skin. Strong topical steroid creams or ointments reportedly are very helpful for lichen sclerosus, especially when it affects the genital areas. However, the response to this treatment varies. While itching may be relieved within days, it can take weeks or months for the skin's appearance to return to normal.  Sometimes, you don't get better when using the cortisone creams. Reasons for this can include Low estrogen levels. Infection. Allergy to the medication. When creams and ointments don't work, your doctor may suggest: Retinoids, or vitamin A-like drugs. Tacrolimus ointment to suppress the bodys misguided immune system. Ultraviolet light treatments (not used on skin of the genitals). Other treatments that may be used instead of steroid creams, or in combination with steroid creams, include calcipotriol cream, topical and systemic retinoids (acitretin), and/or systemic steroids.",

This condition is characterized by back pain and stiffness that typically appear in adolescence or early adulthood. Over time, back movement gradually becomes limited as the bones of the spine (vertebrae) fuse together. This progressive bony fusion is called ankylosis. The earliest symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis result from inflammation of the joints between the pelvic bones (the ilia) and the base of the spine (the sacrum). These joints are called sacroiliac joints, and inflammation of these joints is known as sacroiliitis. The inflammation gradually spreads to the joints between the vertebrae, causing a condition called spondylitis. Ankylosing spondylitis can involve other joints as well, including the shoulders, hips, and, less often, the knees. As the disease progresses, it can affect the joints between the spine and ribs, restricting movement of the chest and making it difficult to breathe deeply. People with advanced disease are also more prone to fractures of the vertebrae. Ankylosing spondylitis affects the eyes in up to 40 percent of cases, leading to episodes of eye inflammation called acute iritis. Acute iritis causes eye pain and increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). Rarely, ankylosing spondylitis can also cause serious complications involving the heart, lungs, and nervous system.",

You may feel aching, burning, numbness, or tingling in your palm, wrist, thumb, or fingers. The thumb muscle can become weak, making it difficult to grasp things. Pain may go up to your elbow.Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs when the median nerve gets compressed at the wrist because of swelling. This is the nerve in the wrist that allows feeling and movement to parts of the hand. Swelling can occur if you: Do repetitive movements with your wrist, such as typing on a computer keyboard, using a computer mouse, playing racquetball or handball, sewing, painting, writing, or using a vibrating tool Are pregnant, menopausal, or overweight Have diabetes, premenstrual syndrome, an underactive thyroid, or rheumatoid arthritis  Injury:  Wrist pain with bruising and swelling is often a sign of an injury. Signs of a possible broken bone include deformed joints and inability to move the wrist, hand, or a finger. There can also be cartilage injuries in the wrist. Other common injuries include sprain, strain, tendinitis, and bursitis. Arthritis: Arthritis is another common cause of wrist pain, swelling, and stiffness. There are many types of arthritis: Osteoarthritis occurs with age and overuse. Rheumatoid arthritis generally affects both wrists. Psoriatic arthritis accompanies psoriasis. Infectious arthritis is a medical emergency. Signs of an infection include redness and warmth of the wrist, fever above 1  (37.7C), and recent illness.  Other Causes  Gout: This occurs when your body produces too much uric acid, a waste product. The uric acid forms crystals in the joints, rather than being excreted in the urine.

Not everyone with osteoarthritis feels pain.Osteoarthritis most commonly affects the hands, lower back, neck, and weight-bearing joints such as knees, hips, and feet. Osteoarthritis affects just joints, not internal organs.HandsOsteoarthritis of the hands seems to run in families. If your mother or grandmother has or had osteoarthritis in their hands, you're at greater-than-average risk of having it, too. Women are more likely than men to have osteoarthritis in the hands. For most women, it develops after menopause.When osteoarthritis involves the hands, small, bony knobs may appear on the end joints (those closest to the nails) of the fingers. They are called Heberden's (HEBerr-denz) nodes. Similar knobs, called Bouchard's (boo-SHARDZ) nodes, can appear on the middle joints of the fingers. Fingers can become enlarged and gnarled, and they may ache or be stiff and numb. The base of the thumb joint also is commonly affected by osteoarthritis.KneesThe knees are among the joints most commonly affected by osteoarthritis. Symptoms of knee osteoarthritis include stiffness, swelling, and pain, which make it hard to walk, climb, and get in and out of chairs and bathtubs. Osteoarthritis in the knees can lead to disability.HipsThe hips are also common sites of osteoarthritis. As with knee osteoarthritis, symptoms of hip osteoarthritis include pain and stiffness of the joint itself. But sometimes pain is felt in the groin, inner thigh, buttocks, or even the knees. Osteoarthritis of the hip may limit moving and bending, making daily activities such as dressing and putting on shoes a challenge.SpineOsteoarthritis of the spine may show up as stiffness and pain in the neck or lower back. In some cases, arthritis-related changes in the spine can cause pressure on the nerves where they exit the spinal column, resulting in weakness, tingling, or numbness of the arms and legs.

There are many types of arthritis: Osteoarthritis occurs with age and overuse.   People with osteoarthritis usually have joint pain and, after rest or inactivity, stiffness for a short period of time. Osteoarthritis most commonly affects the hands, lower back, neck, and weight-bearing joints such as knees, hips, and feet. The disease affects both men and women. Before age 45, osteoarthritis is more common in men than in women. After age 45, osteoarthritis is more common in women. Ankylosing spondylitis is a form of ongoing joint inflammation (chronic inflammatory arthritis) that primarily affects the spine. This condition is characterized by back pain and stiffness that typically appear in adolescence or early adulthood. The earliest symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis result from inflammation of the joints between the pelvic bones (the ilia) and the base of the spine (the sacrum).. The inflammation gradually spreads to the joints between the vertebrae, causing a condition called spondylitis. Ankylosing spondylitis can involve other joints as well, including the shoulders, hips, and, less often, the knees.",

                "article": "Familial dysautonomia is a genetic disorder that affects the development and survival of certain nerve cells. The disorder disturbs cells in the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary actions such as digestion, breathing, production of tears, and the regulation of blood pressure and body temperature. It also affects the sensory nervous system, which controls activities related to the senses, such as taste and the perception of pain, heat, and cold. Familial dysautonomia is also called hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy, type III. Problems related to this disorder first appear during infancy. Early signs and symptoms include poor muscle tone (hypotonia), feeding difficulties, poor growth, lack of tears, frequent lung infections, and difficulty maintaining body temperature. Older infants and young children with familial dysautonomia may hold their breath for prolonged periods of time, which may cause a bluish appearance of the skin or lips (cyanosis) or fainting. This breath-holding behavior usually stops by age 6. Developmental milestones, such as walking and speech, are usually delayed, although some affected individuals show no signs of developmental delay. Additional signs and symptoms in school-age children include bed wetting, episodes of vomiting, reduced sensitivity to temperature changes and pain, poor balance, abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), poor bone quality and increased risk of bone fractures, and kidney and heart problems. Affected individuals also have poor regulation of blood pressure. They may experience a sharp drop in blood pressure upon standing (orthostatic hypotension), which can cause dizziness, blurred vision, or fainting. They can also have episodes of high blood pressure when nervous or excited, or during vomiting incidents. About one-third of children with familial dysautonomia have learning disabilities, such as a short attention span, that require special education classes. By adulthood, affected individuals often have increasing difficulties with balance and walking unaided. Other problems that may appear in adolescence or early adulthood include lung damage due to repeated infections, impaired kidney function, and worsening vision due to the shrinking size (atrophy) of optic nerves, which carry information from the eyes to the brain.",

                "article": "Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disease. It is characterized by the development of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary, or tau, tangles; the loss of connections between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain; and the death of these nerve cells. There are two types of Alzheimer's-early-onset and late-onset. Both types have a genetic component.What Are DNA, Chromosomes, and Genes? The nucleus of almost every human cell contains a \"blueprint\" that carries the instructions a cell needs to do its job. The blueprint is made up of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), which is present in long strands that would stretch to nearly 6 feet in length if attached end to end. The DNA is packed tightly together with proteins into compact structures called chromosomes. Normally, each cell has 46 chromosomes in 23 pairs, which are inherited equally from a person's biological parents. The DNA in nearly all cells of an individual is identical. Each chromosome contains many thousands of segments, called genes. People inherit two copies of each gene from their parents, except for genes on the X and Y chromosomes, which, among other functions, determine a person's sex. The genes \"instruct\" the cell to make unique proteins that, in turn, dictate the types of cells made. Genes also direct almost every aspect of the cell's construction, operation, and repair. Even slight changes in a gene can produce a protein that functions abnormally, which may lead to disease. Other changes in genes may increase or decrease a person's risk of developing a particular disease.Early-Onset Alzheimer's DiseaseEarly-onset Alzheimer's disease occurs between a person's 3  to mid-6  and represents less than 10 percent of all people with Alzheimer's. Some cases are caused by an inherited change in one of three genes, resulting in a type known as early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease, or FAD. For other cases of early-onset Alzheimer's, research suggests there may be a genetic component related to factors other than these three genes.A child whose biological mother or father carries a genetic mutation for early-onset FAD has a 50/50 chance of inheriting that mutation. If the mutation is in fact inherited, the child has a very strong probability of developing early-onset FAD.Early-onset FAD is caused by any one of a number of different single-gene mutations on chromosomes 21, 14, and 1. Each of these mutations causes abnormal proteins to be formed. Mutations on chromosome 21 cause the formation of abnormal amyloid precursor protein (APP). A mutation on chromosome 14 causes abnormal presenilin 1 to be made, and a mutation on chromosome 1 leads to abnormal presenilin 2.Each of these mutations plays a role in the breakdown of APP, a protein whose precise function is not yet fully understood. This breakdown is part of a process that generates harmful forms of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of the disease.Critical research findings about early-onset Alzheimer's have helped identify key steps in the formation of brain abnormalities typical of the more common late-onset form of Alzheimer's. Genetics studies have helped explain why the disease develops in people at various ages.NIA-supported scientists are continuing research into early-onset disease through the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN), an international partnership to study families with early-onset FAD. By observing the Alzheimer's-related brain changes that occur in these families long before symptoms of memory loss or cognitive issues appear, scientists hope to gain insight into how and why the disease develops in both its early- and late-onset forms.In addition, an NIA-supported clinical trial in Colombia, South America, is testing the effectiveness of an amyloid-clearing drug in symptom-free volunteers at high risk of developing early-onset FAD.For more information, see NIA's Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease: A Resource List.Late-Onset Alzheimer's DiseaseMost people with Alzheimer's have the late-onset form of the disease, in which symptoms become apparent in the mid-6  and later. The causes of late-onset Alzheimer's are not yet completely understood, but they likely include a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that affect a person's risk for developing the disease.Researchers have not found a specific gene that directly causes the late-onset form of the disease. However, one genetic risk factor-having one form of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene on chromosome 19-does increase a person's risk. APOE comes in several different forms, or alleles:- APOE epsilon2 is relatively rare and may provide some protection against the disease. If Alzheimer's disease occurs in a person with this allele, it usually develops later in life than it would in someone with the APOE epsilon4 gene. APOE epsilon3, the most common allele, is believed to play a neutral role in the disease-neither decreasing nor increasing risk. APOE epsilon4 increases risk for Alzheimer's disease and is also associated with an earlier age of disease onset. A person has zero, one, or two APOE epsilon4 alleles. Having more APOE epsilon4 alleles increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's.APOE epsilon4 is called a risk-factor gene because it increases a person's risk of developing the disease. However, inheriting an APOE epsilon4 allele does not mean that a person will definitely develop Alzheimer's. Some people with an APOE epsilon4 allele never get the disease, and others who develop Alzheimer's do not have any APOE epsilon4 alleles.Using a relatively new approach called genome-wide association study (GWAS), researchers have identified a number of regions of interest in the genome (an organism's complete set of DNA, including all of its genes) that may increase a person's risk for late-onset Alzheimer's to varying degrees. By 2 , they had confirmed 33 regions of interest in the Alzheimer's genome.A method called whole genome sequencing determines the complete DNA sequence of a person's genome at a single time. Another method called whole exome sequencing looks at the parts of the genome that directly code for the proteins. Using these two approaches, researchers can identify new genes that contribute to or protect against disease risk. Recent discoveries have led to new insights about biological pathways involved in Alzheimer's and may one day lead to effective interventions.",

This excessive accumulation results in an abnormal dilation of the spaces in the brain called ventricles. This dilation causes potentially harmful pressure on the tissues of the brain. Hydrocephalus may be congenital or acquired. Congenital hydrocephalus is present at birth and may be caused by genetic abnormalities or developmental disorders such as spina bifida and encephalocele. Acquired hydrocephalus develops at the time of birth or at some point afterward and can affect individuals of all ages. For example, hydrocephalus ex-vacuo occurs when there is damage to the brain caused by stroke or traumatic injury. Normal pressure hydrocephalus occurs most often among the elderly. It may result from a subarachnoid hemorrhage, head trauma, infection, tumor, or complications of surgery, although many people develop normal pressure hydrocephalus without an obvious cause. Symptoms of hydrocephalus vary with age, disease progression, and individual differences in tolerance to CSF. In infancy, the most obvious indication of hydrocephalus is often the rapid increase in head circumference or an unusually large head size. In older children and adults, symptoms may include headache followed by vomiting, nausea, papilledema (swelling of the optic disk, which is part of the optic nerve), downward deviation of the eyes (called \"sunsetting\"), problems with balance, poor coordination, gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, slowing or loss of development (in children), lethargy, drowsiness, irritability, or other changes in personality or cognition, including memory loss.

When you have too much, though, it puts harmful pressure on your brain. Hydrocephalus can be congenital, or present at birth. Causes include genetic problems and problems with how the fetus develops. An unusually large head is the main sign of congenital hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus can also happen after birth. This is called acquired hydrocephalus. It can occur at any age. Causes can include head injuries, strokes, infections, tumors, and bleeding in the brain. Symptoms include Headache Vomiting and nausea Blurry vision Balance problems Bladder control problems Thinking and memory problems Hydrocephalus can permanently damage the brain, causing problems with physical and mental development. If untreated, it is usually fatal. With treatment, many people lead normal lives with few limitations. Treatment usually involves surgery to insert a shunt. A shunt is a flexible but sturdy plastic tube. The shunt moves the cerebrospinal fluid to another area of the body where it can be absorbed. Medicine and rehabilitation therapy can also help.

Other symptoms may include seizures , abnormal reflexes, slow heartbeat and respiratory rate, headaches, vomiting, irritability, weakness, and visual problems.[1][2][3] It is caused by genetic and non-genetic factors.

Other causes include mutations in many other genes, brain and/or spinal cord malformations, infections, bleeding inside the cavities of the brain (intraventricular hemorrhage), trauma, exposition to certain drugs ( teratogens ) or a congenital tumor of the brain.[1][3] Congenital hydrocephalus can be an isolated malformation or be part of a syndrome where there are other associated malformations.[1] It is most often treated by surgically inserting a shunt system to transport the excess CSF and allow for re-absorption. If left untreated, blindness and continuing mental deterioration may occur.[1][2][3] Hydrocephalus may be subdivided according to the particular defect that exists in the brain and whether the cerebrospinal fluid pressure is high or normal:[1][4] Communicating hydrocephalus is when there is no blockage (obstruction) in the ventricules but the fluid is not absorbed readily, or there is too much fluid to be absorbed. Noncommunicating (obstructive) hydrocephalus is when there is a blockage of the CSF causing widening (dilation) of the pathways that are located upstream of the block, resulting in an increased pressure inside the brain.",

This condition occurs when the nerves in the intestine (enteric nerves) do not form properly during development before birth (embryonic development). This condition is usually identified in the first two months of life, although less severe cases may be diagnosed later in childhood. Enteric nerves trigger the muscle contractions that move stool through the intestine. Without these nerves in parts of the intestine, the material cannot be pushed through, causing severe constipation or complete blockage of the intestine in people with Hirschsprung disease. Other signs and symptoms of this condition include vomiting, abdominal pain or swelling, diarrhea, poor feeding, malnutrition, and slow growth. People with this disorder are at risk of developing more serious conditions such as inflammation of the intestine (enterocolitis) or a hole in the wall of the intestine (intestinal perforation), which can cause serious infection and may be fatal. There are two main types of Hirschsprung disease, known as short-segment disease and long-segment disease, which are defined by the region of the intestine lacking nerve cells. In short-segment disease, nerve cells are missing from only the last segment of the large intestine. This type is most common, occurring in approximately 80 percent of people with Hirschsprung disease. For unknown reasons, short-segment disease is four times more common in men than in women. Long-segment disease occurs when nerve cells are missing from most of the large intestine and is the more severe type. Long-segment disease is found in approximately 20 percent of people with Hirschsprung disease and affects men and women equally. Very rarely, nerve cells are missing from the entire large intestine and sometimes part of the small intestine (total colonic aganglionosis) or from all of the large and small intestine (total intestinal aganglionosis). Hirschsprung disease can occur in combination with other conditions, such as Waardenburg syndrome, type IV; Mowat-Wilson syndrome; or congenital central hypoventilation syndrome. These cases are described as syndromic. Hirschsprung disease can also occur without other conditions, and these cases are referred to as isolated or nonsyndromic.",

The images show the parts of your body in different shades of black and white. This is because different tissues absorb different amounts of radiation. Calcium in bones absorbs x-rays the most, so bones look white. Fat and other soft tissues absorb less and look gray. Air absorbs the least, so lungs look black. The most familiar use of x-rays is checking for fractures (broken bones), but x-rays are also used in other ways. For example, chest x-rays can spot pneumonia. Mammograms use x-rays to look for breast cancer. When you have an x-ray, you may wear a lead apron to protect certain parts of your body. The amount of radiation you get from an x-ray is small.

The retina contains two types of photoreceptor cells: rods and cones. Rods are needed for vision in low light. Cones are needed for vision in bright light, including color vision. The NYX and CACNA1F proteins ensure that visual signals are passed from rods and cones to other retinal cells called bipolar cells, which is an essential step in the transmission of visual information from the eyes to the brain.Mutations in the NYX or CACNA1F gene disrupt the transmission of visual signals between photoreceptors and retinal bipolar cells, which impairs vision.

Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.In X-linked recessive inheritance, a female with one altered copy of the gene in each cell is called a carrier. Carriers of an NYX or CACNA1F mutation can pass on the mutated gene, but most do not develop any of the vision problems associated with X-linked congenital stationary night blindness.

                "article": "Mutations in several genes can cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness. Each of these genes provide instructions for making proteins that are found in the retina. These proteins are involved in sending (transmitting) visual signals from cells called rods, which are specialized for vision in low light, to cells called bipolar cells, which relay the signals to other retinal cells. This signaling is an essential step in the transmission of visual information from the eyes to the brain.Mutations in two genes, GRM6 and TRPM1, cause most cases of this condition. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are necessary for bipolar cells to receive and relay signals. Mutations in other genes involved in the same bipolar cell signaling pathway are likely responsible for a small percentage of cases of autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness.Gene mutations that cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness disrupt the transmission of visual signals between rod cells and bipolar cells or interfere with the bipolar cells' ability to pass on these signals. As a result, visual information received by rod cells cannot be effectively transmitted to the brain, leading to difficulty seeing in low light. The cause of the other vision problems associated with this condition is unclear. It has been suggested that the mechanisms that underlie night blindness can interfere with other visual systems, causing myopia, reduced visual acuity, and other impairments.Some people with autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness have no identified mutation in any of the known genes. The cause of the disorder in these individuals is unknown.",

These chemicals can be in the environment, foods, drugs, insects, plants, or other sources. They are harmless in most people. But if people are sensitive to them, these chemicals (called triggers or allergens) can cause an allergic reaction. That is, the immune system overreacts to the chemicals.However, hives are not always part of an allergic reaction. For example, they may result from autoimmune disorders. In these disorders, the immune system malfunctions, misinterpreting the body's own tissues as foreign and attacking them. Also, some drugs cause hives directly without triggering an allergic reaction. Emotional stress and some physical conditions (such as heat or light) may cause hives for reasons that are not well understood.Hives usually last less than 6 weeks and are classified as acute. If hives last more than 6 weeks, they are classified as chronic. Acute hives  are most commonly caused by Allergic reactions Nonallergic reactions Allergic reactions are often triggered by foods, particularly eggs, fish, shellfish, nuts, and fruits, or by insect stings. Eating even a tiny amount of some foods can suddenly cause hives. But with other foods (such as strawberries), an allergic reaction occurs only after a large amount is eaten. Many drugs, particularly antibiotics, may cause hives. Immediate allergic reactions may also occur when a substance comes into direct contact with the skin (such as latex), after an insect bite, or as a reaction to a substance that is inhaled into the lungs or through the nose.Nonallergic causes of hives include infections, some drugs, some physical stimuli (such as pressure or cold), some emotional stimuli (such as stress), and some food additives.Even though acute hives usually have a specific cause, the cause cannot be identified in about half of cases. Chronic hives  are most commonly caused by Unidentified (idiopathic) conditions Autoimmune disorders Sometimes the cause is easily overlooked, as when people repeatedly consume a food not known to be a trigger, such as a preservative or dye in foods or penicillin in milk. Often, despite the best efforts, the cause remains unidentified.Chronic hives can last for months or years, then sometimes go away for no apparent reason.",

They ask about the persons activities before and during the episode and about possible exposure to substances that can trigger allergic reactions, including drugs being taken. The person is also asked about specific symptoms that could suggest a cause (see Table: Some Causes and Features of Hives), past allergic reactions, and recent travel.The trigger is not always clear from the history, often because the trigger is something that may have been tolerated previously.During the physical examination, doctors first check to see whether the lips, tongue, throat, or airways are swollen. If there is swelling, they begin treatment right away. Then doctors note how the hives look, determine which parts of the body are affected, and check for other symptoms that may help confirm the diagnosis. Doctors may use various physical stimuli to see whether they can trigger the hives. For example, they may apply light pressure, heat, or cold to the skin or stroke the skin.People themselves should not try to trigger their hives, because a severe reaction could occur.TableSome Causes

However, allergen immunotherapy is not always effective. Some people and some allergies tend to respond better than others.Immunotherapy is used most often for allergies to Pollens House dust mites Molds Venom of stinging insects When people are allergic to unavoidable allergens, such as insect venom, immunotherapy helps prevent anaphylactic reactions. Sometimes it is used for allergies to animal dander, but such treatment is unlikely to be useful. Immunotherapy for food allergies is being studied.Immunotherapy is not used when the allergen, such as penicillin and other drugs, can be avoided. However, if people need to take a drug that they are allergic to, immunotherapy, closely monitored by a doctor, can be done to desensitize them.In immunotherapy, tiny amounts of the allergen are usually injected under the skin. The dose is gradually increased until a dose adequate to control symptoms (maintenance dose) is reached. A gradual increase is necessary because exposure to a high dose of the allergen too soon can cause an allergic reaction. Injections are usually given once or twice a week until the maintenance dose is reached. Then injections are usually given every 2 to 4 weeks. The procedure is most effective when maintenance injections are continued throughout the year, even for seasonal allergies.Alternatively, high doses of the allergen may be placed under the tongue (sublingual) and held there for a few minutes, then swallowed. The dose is gradually increased, as for injections. The sublingual technique is relatively new, and how often the dose should be given has not been established. It ranges from every day to 3 times a week. Extracts for grass pollen or house dust mite, placed under the tongue, can be used to help prevent allergic rhinitis.Allergen immunotherapy may take 3 to 4 years to complete.Because immunotherapy injections occasionally cause dangerous allergic reactions, people remain in the doctors office for at least 30 minutes afterward. If they have mild reactions to immunotherapy (such as sneezing, coughing, flushing, tingling sensations, itching, chest tightness, wheezing, and hives), a drugusually an antihistamine, such as diphenhydramine or loratadinemay help.

Omalizumab  is a monoclonal antibody (which is a manufactured [synthetic] antibody designed to interact with a specific substance). Omalizumab binds to immunoglobulin E (IgE), an antibody that is produced in large amounts during an allergic reaction, and prevents IgE from binding to mast cells and basophils and triggering an allergic reaction. Omalizumab may be used to treat persistent or severe asthma when other treatments are ineffective. If hives recur frequently and other treatments are ineffective, it may be helpful.

                "article": "The drugs most commonly used to relieve the symptoms of allergies are antihistamines. Antihistamines block the effects of histamine (which triggers symptoms). They do not stop the body from producing histamine.Taking antihistamines partially relieves the runny nose, watery eyes, and itching and reduces the swelling due to hives or mild angioedema. But antihistamines do not ease breathing when airways are constricted. Some antihistamines (such as azelastine) are also mast cell stabilizers.Antihistamines are available as Tablets, capsules, or liquid solutions to be taken by mouth Nasal sprays Eye drops Lotions or creams Which is used depends on the type of allergic reaction. Some antihistamines are available without a prescription (over-the-counter, or OTC), and some require a prescription. Some that used to require a prescription are now available OTC.Products that contain an antihistamine and a decongestant (such as pseudoephedrine) are also available OTC. They can be taken by adults and children aged 12 years and older. These products are particularly useful when both an antihistamine and a nasal decongestant are needed. However, some people, such as those who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (a type of antidepressant), cannot take these products. Also, people with high blood pressure should not take a decongestant unless a doctor recommends it and monitors its use.The antihistamine diphenhydramine is available OTC as a lotion, cream, gel, or spray that can be applied to the skin to relieve itching, but it should not be used. Its effectiveness is unproved, and it can cause allergic reactions (such as a rash). It can cause extreme drowsiness in children who are also taking an antihistamine by mouth.Did You Know... Over-the-counter skin products that contain diphenhydramine (an antihistamine) should not be used because their effectiveness is unproved and because allergic reactions and other side effects are possible.  Side effects  of antihistamines include anticholinergic effects, such as drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, difficulty with urination, confusion, and light-headedness (particularly after a person stands up), as well as drowsiness. Often, prescription antihistamines have fewer of these effects.Some antihistamines are more likely to cause drowsiness (sedation) than others. Antihistamines that cause drowsiness are widely available OTC. People should not take these antihistamines if they are going to drive, operate heavy equipment, or do other activities that require alertness. Antihistamines that cause drowsiness should not be given to children under 2 years old because they may have serious or life-threatening side effects. These antihistamines are also a particular problem for older people and for people with glaucoma, benign prostatic hyperplasia, constipation, or dementia because of the drugs anticholinergic effects. In general, doctors use antihistamines cautiously in people with cardiovascular disease.Not everyone reacts the same way to antihistamines. For example, Asians seem to be less susceptible to the sedative effects of diphenhydramine than are people of Western European origin. Also, antihistamines cause the opposite (paradoxical) reaction in some people, making them feel nervous, restless, and agitated.TableSome Antihistamines Drug Degree of Anticholinergic Effects* Degree of Drowsiness Nonprescription (over-the-counter) Brompheniramine Moderate Some Cetirizine Few to none Little to none in most people and moderate in some people Chlorpheniramine Moderate Some Clemastine Strong Moderate Desloratadine Few to none Little to none Diphenhydramine Strong Extreme Fexofenadine Few to none Little to none Loratadine Few to none Little to none Prescription Acrivastine Few to none Little to none Azelastine Few to none Some Cyproheptadine Moderate Some Dexchlorpheniramine Moderate Some Hydroxyzine Moderate Extreme Levocetirizine Few to none Little to none Mizolastine Few to none Little to none Promethazine Strong Extreme * Anticholinergic effects include dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, difficulty with urination, confusion, and light-headedness (particularly after a person stands up).
